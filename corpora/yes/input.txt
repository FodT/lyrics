Who was it organizing the right
To follow my leader
Seems we look and stand around waiting
For a sign from God
Speaking for myself
The christian need
The muslim need
The buddhist need
To testify the need for brotherly love

I know there's so many hundred things
Things to talk about
Making us laugh
Just like a shakespeare revolution
Please organize our spiritual evolution
Do that you'll feel it
And we'll feel it
Appreciate it's almost like love
It's almost like love
It's almost like love
It's almost like love

Saint or sinner
Makes no difference in who you believe
In a world of superstition
Caught in a total nuclear greed

Pioneers of the twenty first century
Looking on and looking fast
To try and fix and try and help
This very need
I know there's so many ways
That we can work it out
Whether we live or die

Please organize the simple evolution
so there's got to be
so we can see
to be free
It's almost like love
It's almost like love
It's almost like love

So promised in a hundred letters
Should be getting to you any time now
So promised a surprise for you
For getting so far from now
It's almost like love
The way the first one out discovers
It's almost like
How many times can you recover
It's almost

It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like
It's almost like love



Let us be lovers, we'll marry our fortunes together
I've got some real estate in my bag
So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
And we walked off, walked off, walked off,to look for America

Kathy, I said, as we boarded the greyhound in Pittsburgh
Michigan seems like a dream to me now
Took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
They've all gone to look for America
All gone to look for America

Laughing on the bus, playing games with faces
She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
I said be careful, his bow tie is really a camera

"Kathy, I'm lost", I said, although I knew she was sleeping
I'm empty and aching and I don't know why I'm
Counting the cars on the New Jersey turnpike
And they've all gone to look for America
All gone to look for America
All gone to look for America



<i>[I Cord Of Life]</i>

A man conceived a moment's answers to the dream
Staying the flowers daily, sensing all the themes
As a foundation left to create the spiral aim
A movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

Changed only for a sight the sound, the space agreed
Between the picture of time behind the face of need
Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotions revealed as the ocean maid
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

Coins and crosses
(Turn round tailor, assaulting)
Never know their fruitless worth
(all the mornings of the interest shown,
presenting one another to the cord)
Cords are broken
(All left dying, rediscovered
Of the door that turned round)
Locked inside the mother Earth
(To close the cover, all the
interest shown)
They won't hide, hold, they won't tell you
(To turn one another, to the
sign at the time float your climb)
Watching the world, watching all of the world
Watching us go by

And you and I climb over the sea to the valley
And you and I reached out for reasons to call

<i>[II Eclipse]</i>

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
Emotions revealed as the ocean maid
As a movement regained and regarded both the same
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

<i>[III The Preacher, The Teacher]</i>

Sad preacher nailed upon the coloured door of time
Insane teacher be there reminded of the rhyme
There'll be no mutant enemy we shall certify
Political ends as sad remains will die
Reach out as forward tastes begin to enter you
Oooh, ooh

I listened hard but could not see
Life tempo change out and inside me
The preacher trained in all to lose his name
The teacher travels, asking to be shown the same
In the end we'll agree, we'll accept, we'll immortalize
That the truth of the man maturing in his eyes
All complete in the sight of seeds of life with you

Coming quickly to terms of all expression laid
As a moment regained and regarded both the same
Emotion revealed as the ocean maid
A clearer future, morning, evening, nights with you

<i>[IV Apocalypse]</i>

And you and I climb, crossing the shapes of the morning
And you and I reach over the sun for the river
And you and I climb, clearer towards the movement
And you and I called over valleys of endless seas



Out of the brightest tree the moon became the morning sun,
And there again reflected on the dreams of everyone.
Out of the starlight night the telling of all our lives,
And racing faster than the Northwestern World.

Starpoint to signal our endlessness
Starpoint to signal this evermore
Starpoint to compass: We look to the North
To return to the centre: Angkor Wat.

<i>[Cambodian poetry; translation follows]</i>

I am a child of the universe.

I deserve total recognition of this in the light of God.

Being a child of the universe,
I want to live in a world without war
I want to live in a world without starvation
I want to live in a world without pestilence
I want to live in a world of love, peace and harmony

Because I am a child of the universe.



I could not take it oh so seriously really
When you called and said you'd seen a UFO
But then it dawned on me the message in writing
Spelt out a meeting never dreamed of before

I looked out, in the night
Strange and startling
Was the voice of time just saying
There's got to be a linking of everyone
Got to be a centre
It all comes flooding back

Arriving thru the eons of times immortal power of the future to behold
Vessels of a different impression, none that we could ever hope to have known

So look out, in the night
Once they arrive
Oh that perennial light

Impress a bolder Empire of Energy
In the ships we see
The coming of outer space

...

You say there's no reason to conjure
With the force as it has been known to be seen
You say I'm a fool a believer
Put your feet on the earth it is green

But look out, in the night
Wait for they arrive
To start such sciences anew
Here it is the coming of outer space
Such a pure delight
The coming of outer space



And in the ruins of the balloon
Stood a man with glasses held high
Wondering when to do it again
Have another fly into the sky
Somewhere flying high

Astral traveller
Leaving without her
Wondering where lights go
Leave out the body load

Once in the air, people who dare
Get a great respect in being (astral traveller)
Heavenly flight, wondrous night
And all the sights worth seeing
Just believe in

Astral traveller
Leaving without her
Wondering where lights go
Leave out the body load

Once in the air, people who dare
Get a great respect in being (astral traveller)
Heavenly flight, wondrous night
And all the sights worth seeing
Just believe in

Astral traveller
Leaving without her
Wondering where lights go
Leave out the body load



Once a peaceful man laid his old head down by a river,
Thought about his childhood life, his father and forgiver,
Couldn't hide away, hide away.

He controlled the horses with a handclap or a whisper,
Drink he couldn't combat but he knew he was no sinner,
Couldn't hide away, hide away.

He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure,
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink
Not to hide away, hide away.

Better men have realized alone is not a venture,
A decent man would realize alone is not a venture,
Just to hide away, hide away.

He told all his sons of all the antics of adventure,
Then he told another one who drove himself to drink
Not to hide away, hide away.



High vibration go on 
To the sun
Oh, let my heart dreaming
Past a mortal as me
Where can I be?

Wish the sun to stand still
Reaching out to touch our all being
Past all mortal as we
Here we can be
(He can be here)
(Be here now)
Here we can be

Suns | High | Streams | Through
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)

Strong | Dreams | Reign | Here
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touch
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touch

(Star | Song)

Star | Song | Age | Less
Awaken gentle mass touching
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touching
(Gentle mass touch)
Awaken gentle mass touching
Touching...
Touching...
Touching...

Workings of man
Set to ply out historical life
Reregaining the flower of the fruit of his tree
All awakening
All restoring you 

Workings of man
Crying out from the fire set aflame
By his blindness to see 
That the warmth of his being
Is promised for his seeing 
His reaching so clearly 

Workings of man
Driven far from the path
Rereleased in inhibitions
So that all is left for you
All is left for you
All is left for you
All is left for you NOW... 

Master of images
Songs cast a light on you
Hark thru dark ties
That tunnel us out of sane existence
In challenge as direct
As eyes see young stars assemble 

Master of light
All pure chance
As exists cross divided
In all encircling mode
Oh closely guided plan
Awaken in our heart 

Master of soul
Set to touch
All impenetrable youth
Ask away
That thought be contact
With all that's clear
Be honest with yourself
There's no doubt 
No doubt 

Master of time
Setting sail
Over all our lands
And as we look
Forever closer
Shall we now bid
Farewell farewell... 

High vibration go on
To the sun, oh let my heart dreaming
Past a mortal as me
Where can I be 

Wish the sun to stand still
Reaching out to touch our own being
Past all mortal as we
Here we can be

Like the time I ran away
Turned around and you were standing close to me
Like the time I ran away
Turned around and you were standing close to me



Never underestimate the loving
How we intertwine our very soul
How we fill each other's spaces to lose control
When you're talking, be the children
Who stand on solid ground
Never underestimate the giving that will bring you around

I'll be there, to bring you this love in the morning
I'll be there, to bring you the stars at night
I'll be there, just waiting to hear you singing

Never underestimate a giver
The gift of love will surely be
When you're asking for the secrets to set you free
When you're talking to the friendship
That love of higher self
This gift of love is the answer to all your doubts

Be the one, giving in to love
Never let the good in life desert you
Be the one, giving in to love
Never let the fools destroy your dreams
Be the one, giving in to love
I can dream myself every minute
So how did we become, masters of limitation?

I'll be there
I'll be there
I'll be there, to make it right for you

Giving in, giving in to love
It's the balance of this everyday feeling
Giving in, giving in to love
Without love our dreams become illusion
Giving in, giving in to right love
I can hear you singing every minute
So you can sing the song, and see the truth



Sparkling trees of Silver foam
cast shadows soft in winter's home
Swaying branches breaking sound
In lonely forests trembling ground.

Masquerading leaves of blue
Run circles round the morning dew
In patterns understood by you
Reaching out beyond and before

Time like gold dust brings mind down
To levels hidden underground
Say a few words to the wind
That's all thats left of winters friend.

Reaching the snow
In the days of the cold
Casting a Spell out of Ice
Now that your gone
the summers too long
and it seems like the end of my life
Reaching out beyond and before

Time like gold dust brings mind down
Time like gold dust brings mind down



<i>[verse 1]</i>
Such a strange pre-occupation
Such a strange peculiar breed
How it's shining in its armour
Made of gold and made of steel
It can strike a chord inside you
Like a generation's need
Speaking happy words of promise

<i>[chorus 1:]</i>
Big generator
Lives out of sight
Big generator
Hands upon the wheel

Moving to the left
Movin'
Moving to the right
big generator
moving through the night

Second nature sacrifice
Even if you close your eyes
We exist through this strange disguise

<i>[verse 2:]</i>
I have heard it said to someone
Or maybe it was me
There is a reason to experience
Psychedelic so we could see
To be growing up before us
Like the black and white of love
Be the focus
Be the chorus

<i>[chorus 2:]</i>
Big generator
Hands upon the wheel
Big generator
In for the kill

Second nature comes alive
Even if you close your eyes
We exist through this strange device

Moving to the left
Moving to the right
Big generator
Moving through the night

We are the voices of the big generator

Moving through the night
Movin'

Flying out the soft machine, we offer
All surprise to you
Praise oh praise this anthem generator

Moving through the night
Movin'

We are the voice of every. . .



This state in the matrix of the real world thinking
This way is meant to surface through the 'net
This train is set to mystify
This day in the history of the future
This train is set to justify
Whether you're ready or not
This day is of the meeting now

If they don't give us the keys how are we supposed to get ready?
If they don't give us the keys how are we to survive?
Cover me up and bring me to the power
Cover me up and bring me to the power
Cover me up and bring me to the power

All I know is all I want to give you

Cover me up get closer to the fire
Cover me up get closer to the power
Cover me up get closer to the power
Cover me up get closer now
Cover me up get closer to the power

God talk
God talk, now, talk
God talk
Give a little-ation
God talk, revelation
God talk, revelation

If they don't give 'em the keys
If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they supposed to be ready
If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they to divine
If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they supposed to be ready
If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they to survive
Cover me up and bring me to the power
Cover me up and bring me revelation

If we don't give 'em the keys
How are they supposed to be ready
If you don't give 'em the keys
How are they to survive
The power of love can open every heart in everyone
Minute by minute...........



We have heaven

We have heaven



Can you imagine what it's like seeing life 
From the other side 
Do you imagine darkened light, starless night? 
You might need a guide 

And will the illusion confuse you, play with your thoughts 
And alter your mind 
Or become a delusion, include you 
Change your existence 
For another kind 

See what you see for yourself, 'til your heart 
Is open wide 
Wish what you wish for yourself, and you find it there 
And you believe it 
And you believe it 

Can you imagine what it's like, seeing life 
From the other side 
Do you imagine light darkened, starless night 
You might need a guide

And will the illusion confuse you, play with your thoughts 
And alter your mind 
Or become a delusion, excuse you 
Change your existence 
For another kind 

See what you see for yourself, 'til your heart 
Is open wide 
Wish what you wish for yourself, and you find it here 
And you believe it 
And you believe it



I'm moving through some changes
I'll never be the same
Something you did touched me
There's no one else to blame

The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
We've given up pretending
As if you didn't care

Change changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

I look into the mirror
I see no happiness
All the warmth I gave you
Has turned to emptiness
The love we had has fallen
The love we used to share
You've left me here believing
In love that wasn't there

Change changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise - Well you get what's coming
One word can bring you round
Changes

When I look into your eyes and try to find out how
There's no way to save it now
And everything I feel
Changes
Keep looking for
Changes
Changes

For some reason you're questioning why
I always believe it gets better
One difference between you and I
Your heart is inside your head

One word from you
One word from me
A clear design on your liberty
Who could believe when love has gone
How we move on like everyone

Only such fools
Only such jealous hearts

Only through love changes come

Change changing places
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

One road to loneliness
It's always the same
One road to happiness
It's calling your name

Change changing places - Changes
Root yourself to the ground
Capitalize on this good fortune
One word can bring you round
Changes

Change changing places
Changes
Root yourself to the ground
Word to the wise - Well you get what's coming
One word - One word can bring you round
Changes



<i>[A) Children Of Light]</i>

Distant as the distant thunder
Where equal rights for (will) rent assunder
Equal rights for equal people
(this) disregard for love's equality

Bringing back the signs to no-man's land
Where diamonds and gold in hand
Will barter as the homeless burn
Someday will it be our turn? 

Why this consciousness this desire
To expand the flame of revolution
With a (the) gothic hand in (of) fire persecution
Blood-letting and (in) spinning pain? 

Why this hungry media delivering
Questions answers blessed forgivers (plus forgive us)
Millions of racial inequalities
We all are one
All are sacred

Be the birth of a nation
Stop this aggravation
So uninspired
And (to) question man's inhumanity
And lack of love for his cosmic god

Children of light don't be afraid
Children of light haven't you heard
Gone are the days in black and white
Children of light don't be afraid

Distant as the distant thunder
Where equal rights for (will) rent assunder
Equal rights for equal people
(this) disregard for love's equality

Bringing back the signs to no-man's land
Where diamonds and gold in hand
Will barter as the homeless burn
Someday will it be our turn? 

Someday will it be our turn? 
Someday will it be our turn? 

Children of light don't be afraid
Children of light haven't you heard
Gone are the days in black and white
Children of light don't be afraid

The day the Circus of Heaven came to town
Local folks lined the streets in a Midwestern town
Waiting anxiously for the parade to begin all round
On the very last day

A Unicorn headed the Mystical way
Surrounded by what seemed a thousand golden angels at play
Behind were Centaurs, elves, bright fairies all in colours of Jade
On the very final day

For what seemed only just a moment in time
Seven solemn flying silvered regal horses rode by
Seven golden chariots in tow, a wonder to behold
The Seven Lords of the Mountains of time
There then arose where nothing really stood there before
A giant tent rising one thousand feet high from the floor
Towns people flocked inside with their eyes all amazed
To greet the Seventh Lord of the Seventh age
A fanfare rang out in an incredible sound
Bringing out the strangest visions perfect harmony round
Any dreams he asked would they like to have seen
From historical or mythical scenes

Then there above their heads just as vivid as life
Each vision transported in multitudes inventing light
Grecian galleons, The Sack of Troy, to the Gardens of Babylon
A play of millions roared along
The gigantic dreams of Alexander the Great
Civil wars where brothers fought and killed their friendship in hate
All seen by Zeus performing scenes of the magical way
The day the circus came to town

Outside great animals as tame as the trees
Angels high in starlight dancing streets
Tuning their colours with indigo and gold
Dropping violet, red and emerald snow
As the circus finally changed its invisible course
A new world to be found

On the dreamy ground we walked upon
I turned to my son and said
"Was that something beautiful, amazing, wonderful, extraordinary beautiful?"
"Oh! it was OK!! But there were no clowns, no tigers, lions or bears,
candy-floss, toffee apples, no clowns."



City of love City of love City of love

Once bitten twice shy
No - No regrets at all
Justice - Body smooth take over
Good girls they work the city
Good guys they spike you hard
How they jive ad jingle
When you're in their backyard

Street corner wonder lust
Beckoning the good guy
Take this get that
Have a good time

He young and tactile
He ready for anything that is
How they jive and jingle
They've read the book that gives

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

Supervise this good treatment
Alternative line by line
So the street guys so observant
Take him for a ride
Have a good time
Like a legend the man he sharp
His woman gladly watching
As he strides out of the dark
Better be quick get away

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

<i>[Solo]</i>

Good timing has its good price
One trick and you're stuck with the dice
How they jive and jingle
When you're their sacrifice

Fast as lightning
Go - Go get high - He's looking good
Once bitten twice shy
No woman no cry
No woman don't cry

We'll be waiting for the night
We'll be waiting for the night to come

<i>[repeat three times]</i>



I once knew a sweet young girl;
Her body was her world of love,
Her laughter was as happiness is.
Of all the times I treasure this.
And on a day we will remember,
On a clear day we will love forever.

I once knew a sweet young dream,
That if life itself were all we had
And who are we to ask for more;
Let's not decide, let's be sure.
And on a day we will remember,
On a clear day we'll all be together,
Together.



<i>[I The Solid Time Of Change]</i>

A seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace
And rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
And achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar
Then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour
And assessing points to nowhere, leading every single one
A dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun
And take away the plain in which we move
And choose the course you're running

Down at the edge, round by the corner
Not right away, not right away
Close to the edge, down by a river
Not right away, not right away

Crossed the line around the changes of the summer
Reaching out to call the color of the sky
Passed around a moment clothed in mornings faster than we see
Getting over all the time I had to worry
Leaving all the changes far from far behind
We relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

Down at the end, round by the corner
Close to the edge, just by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down
Now that it's all over and done
Now that you find, now that you're whole

<i>[II Total Mass Retain]</i>

My eyes convinced, eclipsed with the younger moon attained with love
It changed as almost strained amidst clear manna from above
I crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
There's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand

Sad courage claimed the victims standing still for all to see
As armoured movers took approached to overlook the sea
There since the cord, the license, or the reasons we understood will be

Down at the edge, close by a river
Close to the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by the corner
Down at the edge, round by the river

Sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory
All in all, the journey takes you all the way
As apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known
Guessing problems only to deceive the mention
Passing paths that climb halfway into the void
As we cross from side to side, we hear the total mass retain

Down at the edge, round by the corner
Close to the end, down by a river
Seasons will pass you by
I get up, I get down

<i>[III I Get Up, I Get Down]</i>

In her white lace, you could clearly see the lady sadly looking
Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

Two million people barely satisfy
Two hundred women watch one woman cry, too late
The eyes of honesty can achieve
(She would gladly say it amazement of her story)
How many millions do we deceive each day?
(Asking only interest could be laid upon the children of her domain)

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

In charge of who is there in charge of me
(She could clearly see the lady sadly looking)
Do I look on blindly and say I see the way?
(Saying that she'd take the blame
For the crucifixion of her own domain)
The truth is written all along the page
(She would gladly say it amazement of her story)
How old will I be before I come of age for you?
(Asking only interest could be laid upon the children of her domain)

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down

<i>[IV Seasons Of Man]</i>

The time between the notes relates the color to the scenes
A constant vogue of triumphs dislocate man, so it seems
And space between the focus shape ascend knowledge of love
As song and chance develop time, lost social temperance rules above
Ah, ah

Then according to the man who showed his outstretched arm to space
He turned around and pointed, revealing all the human race
I shook my head and smiled a whisper, knowing all about the place
On the hill we viewed the silence of the valley
Called to witness cycles only of the past
And we reach all this with movements in between the said remark

Close to the edge, down by the river
Down at the end, round by the corner
Seasons will pass you by
Now that it's all over and done
Called to the seed, right to the sun
Now that you find, now that you're whole
Seasons will pass you by

I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down
I get up, I get down



Dance in the light. Dance in the light
Dance in the light. Dance in the light.  
     
Dance in the light. Everything is all right
Dance in the light of day, dance in the light of night.

Dance in the light. Dance in the light.    
Dance in the light. Dance in the light. 
           
Dance in the light. Dance in the light.                                                                   
Dance in the light. Everything is all right. 

Dance in the light of day, dance in the light of night. 

Ooh, let it go through. Oooh, here it comes
Oooh, here we go.



Come into the light, passing through wisdom.
Hoping for love, all at the knees.
You come across; you get too much.
Everybody needs it; don't show your body.

So dangerous - This fear of love
So dangerous - Can you handle it?
So dangerous - To love
So dangerous - Everyone else can do it

Walking the street, you're breaking your love.
Lose your heart, all in a mess.
In the middle of the night, looking for a little
And to the some; don't show your body.

Death defying - Hurt by love
Passing through shadows - Don't lose your body

So dangerous - This fear of love
So dangerous - Can you handle it?
So dangerous - To keep this fear of love
So dangerous - To let it go

I don't imagine I see it; don't get confused.
In the light, through the night...
Look in the light, through the night
Of what you're searching for.

Hide from your heart here in the arms of wanting.
Hide from the dark here in the arms of love.
Run from the fear inside the darkest reaches.
Look to yourself; you'll see the light of fear.

So dangerous - This fear of love
So dangerous - Can you handle it?
So dangerous - To love
So dangerous - Everyone else can do it
So dangerous - Give to the hear of love.



This song of evening's light would charge my memory to flight
The trees that listen
Swift wings do carry on through constant gardens they offer delight
It is the evening

In deepest woods and fern young deer step light through morning's mist
Ascend the swallows
First light streams through the treetops bouncing as the flowers illuminate
The breath of morning

This day of days I thought I lay in peace midst grass so green
To reach to skyward
Where larks do sing such high delights do pour into my senses
The days are blessings



You need them to open the seed
To see what goes on in the world
Here in my mind
Catch the wind and hold on tight
To what we'll find
And hear what goes on in the world
Here is all you see
Everything is made for you from me

If there's anything you'd like to say that could help me in any way
Cause I've been waiting for so long for you to come along
Help me on that day
When you take over all the things heaven has made for you
Is there anything you think you should know
Is there anything before I go?

Dear Father <i>[repeat]</i>
I'm hungry, I'm cold
Feeling terribly old
I don't think I can see
I'm not feeling good like I think I should

They're on their own, needing a face, a place,
Hope and mind, a home
To see what goes on in the world
They're who you need
To show them why they're wrong, oh why indeed
We need to go on in the world
Here is all you see
Everything is made for you from me.

If there's any complication that you'd like to talk over with me about
'Cause I've been waiting for so long for you to come along
We can work it all out

<i>[repeat pre-chorus]</i>

Dear Father <i>[repeat]</i>
You must be putting me on
'Cause most of their minds are gone
They run on T'understand me
I'm not feeling good like I think I should

Dear Father <i>[repeat]</i>
Can I give it a miss
'Cause I'm not ready for this
I don't think I can see
I'm not feeling good like I think I should

Dear Father <i>[repeat]</i>
Won't you leave me alone
Won't you let me go home
I don't think I could see
Lord, they'd crucify me
I just couldn't do that
'Cause that's not where it's at now.



That's what you say
Does it really happen to you
Does that explain
This is the season for this display.
To take a look
In time to move together

<i>[Chorus:]</i>
Time is the measure before it's begun
Slips away like running water
Live for the pleasure, live by the gun
Heritage for sun and daughter
Down to the slaughter up for the fun
Up for anything.

Could this be true
Does it ever happen to you
And can you prove
That wheels go 'round in reason
You take a step
In time,
To move together

<i>[Chorus]</i>

You walk, the way
You take, the path
To be, assured
You draw, a graph
The scale, you use
Is all, on black
Be brave, the weight
Will make, the heat
There is, no way
To take-it back.

<i>[Repeat chorus]</i>



Don't be so cruel hurting yourself 
Don't be so greedy making it bad 
Don't be so dark echoing out 
Don't spend the day waiting for me 

After all you didn't have to do it 
You broke your own heart; it hurt you so bad 
Why don't you take your defense down a little 
Or you won't understand at all 

Don't go, don't go let it 
Don't go, don't go let it 
Don't take love for granted 

We were supposed to be together forever 
Don't take love 
We were supposed to be together forever, yeah yeah 
Don't take love 

Don't be so sad scream at the moon 
Don't let your words come out too soon 
You beat yourself up 
So don't spend a day, hey, waiting for me 
I can see you had to be your own father 
I know he walked out on you 
Hey, but that's in the past 
You see you don't have a leg to stand on 
You're just fooling yourself again 

Don't go take it out 
Don't go let it 
Don't go take it out 
Don't go let it 
Don't take love 
We were supposed to be friends forever, yeah yeah 
Don't go take it out 
Don't go let it in 
We were supposed to be friends forever, yeah yeah 
Don't go take it out 
We were supposed to be friends forever… 

So he booked himself a trip, extended holiday 
None of this always working late 
The porter took him to his room; he headed for the bar 
To get another drink 
She got a phone call saying her love had ran away 
Just another phone call, another bad day 
She packed her keys got out of town 
Stole her best friend's car 
Promised she would bring it back 
That's what friends are for 

Hey do me a favor call me sometime 
Do a good deed 
Don't waste a minute waiting for me 
Don't take love, take take take it in 
For granted, take take take it out 
Don't go, don't go let it in 
We were supposed to be together forever, forever. 
Don't take love, take take take it in 
For granted, take take take it out 
Don't take love, take take take it in 
For granted, take take take it out 
We were supposed to be together forever, yeah yeah 
Don't take love for granted 
Don't take love for granted 
We were supposed to be together forever, yeah yeah 
Don't go take it out 
Don't go let it in



You're first
I'm last
You're thirst 
I'm asked to justify
Killing our last heaven beast
Don't hunt the whale

In beauty 
Vision
Do we
Offer much
If we reason with destiny, gonna lose our touch
Don't kill the whale

...

Rejoice 
They sing
They worship their own space
In a moment of love, they will die for their grace
Don't kill the whale

If time will allow
We will judge all who came
In the wake of our new age to stand for the frail
Don't kill the whale



Amidst these mountains again, I realize
I'd better change my reservations
Came here so hastily
I'm not in such a hurry
Now I'm left, holding the key, the key

Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer

Amidst these mountains again, I realize
As the train pulled out the station
I recall waving to you
For on the winter morning
Some might have shed a tear, or two
Amidst these mountains again
Amidst these mountains again

Don't take no for an answer
Don't take no for an answer



Dreamtime begins 
Where every song is the perfect place 
Words never spoken 
Are the strongest resounding 

Life force is meant for us 
To remember the stars, the earth 
Still we forget 
So asleep in this dreamtime 
Lost in this dreamtime day 

Take me up into that freedom place and justify 
Electrify the senses sharpen than the soul intensify 
Nominate that we can break out take, take, take, take together 
Hesitate and you will dance on this earth to, to forever 

You are the choice forever trying 
Give you wings forever flying 
You can fly, you can glide, you can dream 
You can see through this interactive vision streaming 

You have the faith 
So busy trying 
So let it go 
Forever flying 

To the sky, to the earth, to the moon, to the sea 
To the sun, to the stars, to the dream you become 

Nothing left to lose 
Nothing more to prove 
With wings of gold 
You'll fly away 

Talk among the prophets 
Give you something 
Talk among the teachers 
Tell you something 
Talk among your one true self now 
Forever, forever, forever, forever 

Dreamtime begins 
Where every song is the perfect place 
Words never spoken 
Are the strongest resounding 

Life force is meant for us 
To remember the stars, the earth 
Still we forget 
So asleep in this dreamtime 
Lost in this dreamtime day 

Take me up into that freedom place and justify 
On the silent wings of gold my soul intensify 
Nominate that we can take, take, take, take, take, together 
Demonstrate that we can break it out and take it forever 

Here's what you know 
Here's what you're asking 
The soul is everlasting



Hold your head up high you know you've
Come a long way, a long way
Tainted as a fugitive with nothing left to say
Temptation may come hope your vision doesn't stray
In the name of God you may be forced away

Moving forward to the only place you know
Side tracked by some indiscretion
Changing as you go
Temptation may come hope your
Conscience doesn't hide
The longest trip you'll take is inside

It's the last time telling myself everything
Call me over then bring me back again
It's the last chance telling myself
That I believe
Your forever is mine and all I need

Now life tell me now in your arms
All I really need is you by my side
I sing this to you all the world and all it is
I bring this to you this gift of love

And the world turns and the world turns
Time tells all we know we look to it
Jesus on the radio
Pledge me what you got I'll give you
Eternal resting spot
How intense I pray depends on how much you pay

It's the last time getting it this life
First calling in a silent spring
It's the first time getting it this life
First calling in a silent spring
Fear strikes deeper than visionary
Screams and tears never justify this love

Talk talk listening
Like the first words ever to reach out
Talk talk
Like the first sounds in a silent spring
Talk talk listening
Like the first words ever to reach out to you
Talk talk
Like the first sound you start to sing

So take your time
Look round and see
The most in time is where you're meant to be
For they talk too loud
And take the hope and peace from your heart
We call this surrender
Slowly towards the north
And this endless dream giving ourselves everything
We're deserving we're gonna bring it back again
It's the last time telling myself everything
It's the last time bring me back bring me back again
When the world brings you down
You can search you inside
For the love you will find (bring me back home)
When the world brings you down
You can search you inside
When the world brings you down
I've waited so long
When the world brings you down
You gotta play this living game
When the world brings you down
So take your time
Look round and see
The most in time is where you're meant to be
For you are light
Inside your dreams
For you will find that it's something
That touches me



Look at the sad goodbyes
Everyday's a killing time
Sun coming up outside
No men are born this time
Saturday's child stays home
Nothing to say so long

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day

Grocery store, ten bucks
Just making change for plastic cherries
Up in a tree, jaybird
Laughing at me, no word
Everyone looks, you can't see
We can't be ignored easily

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day

Soft within the wayward things
Like ecstasy
The sound of trees
Most anything
What a baby sees

Beautiful face, alright
Many a place, out of sight
Old woman there with red shoes
One million balloons, all used
Drive over hills, forget your fear
Getting it out of second gear

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day

Well, well, well
Another day
Well, well, well
Another day



When I'm walking beside her
People tell me I'm lucky
Yes I know I'm a lucky guy
I remember the first time
I was lonely without her
Can't stop thinking about her now
Every little thing she does
She does for me yeah
And you know the things she does
She does for me
When I'm with her I'm happy
Just to know that she loves me
Yes I know that she love me now
There is one thing I am sure of
I will love her forever
Because I know love will never die



Here we are trying to mend all the broken hearts
In a world where the pain is the fear
Ain't no doubt there's a method to madness here
Set your clock to the start of a brand new year

Shine your heart to the universe and get the news
Not alone never have been, never will be
See the truth, not to mention the promise made
See them all, see them all high on judar rhythm

We began at the very first spring
How the promise will come when the promise is made
We will sing at the very first spring
That the promise will come when the promise is made
Promise is made, promise is made

Shake me up, take me up
Face to face

Lift me up, shake me up
Face to face

Make me real, make me longing to see you smile
Shall we dancing, shall we be the dancing down under 
In this life of lives, are we ready to take the chance 
Moving to the rhythm, here at last to 

Believe
To believe

We began at the first real spring
How the promise will come when the promise is made
We will sing at the very first spring
That the promise will come when the promise is made

We began at the first real spring - ya
We will sing at the very first spring - ya

We began at the first real spring
We will sing at the very first spring
How the promise will come when the promise is made
Promise is made, promise is made

We began at the first real spring
That the promise will come when the promise is made
We will sing at the very first spring
That the promise will come when the promise is made
Promise is made, promise is made

Shake it up, take me up
Face to face 
Face to face
Face to face



Person to person woman to man
Sing me a story to reach me
Teach me to teach me to understand
All these emotions I miss you

So you leave her
Can't believe her
Can't escape
Final eyes
Final eyes

Person to person woman to man
Send me this song that will teach me
Like a river without a stream
Night time without dreaming
Send me this song that will reach me

So you leave me
Can't deceive me
See through me
Final eyes
Final eyes

And I know you think there's nothing
There's nothing more to say
And I know that I've got something
I've got something to say

If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

Person to person woman to man
Send me this song that will teach me
Like a river without a stream
Night time without dreaming
Send me this song that will reach me

So you leave me
Can't deceive me
See through me
Final eyes

And I know you think there's nothing
There's nothing more to say
Don't hide behind the headlines oh yea
I've got something to say

If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you
If ever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

Whenever I needed
Whenever I needed
Whenever I needed

Someone

If ever I needed
Whenever I needed someone
You were there when I needed you

You saved me from falling
Saved me from falling
I'm so in love with you



Finally... We put it to the test
Dedicate to the true believer in you 
Finally... Put it to the test
Finally

Make no mistake to the mainstream
Music be the master planner
Just like the books you read
You'll hear it on your radio scanner

It's not so much what you know 
Or who you know that's coming
Its what you do regardless
Its what you do... eventually

Finally... We put it to the test
Dedicate to the true believer in you 
Finally... Put it to the test
Finally

I've seen them running, down and out
Never mind the good intentions 
A dreamer with a reason to live
Is as clear as his next invention

You take a second look to find
A second chance at giving
The voices say do not despair
There's a real good reason you're living

I could feel the earth moving
I could see sky falling
We can chase the storm
We can sing the rain
Walk the final distance
Live this life again

Finally... We put it to the test
Dedicate to the true believer in you
Finally... Put it to the test telling me to let go

I can feel the earth moving (I can sing the rain)
I can feel the rain coming (live this life again)
I can feel the storm 
I can sing the rain
I can free my heart
Live this life again 
You can choose to stand
You can choose to fall
You can see the rain
You can have it all

I can feel the rain coming
I can feel the earth moving
I can feel the love coming

I can feel the earth moving
I can feel the rain coming
I can feel the love coming
I can feel the earth moving



Take a table
In the evening
By the waterside

Lonely eyes watch
As the moon shines
Down a silver tine

Looking out from this position
Are things what they seem?

It's been spreading out from
One decision
Into this bad dream

Out on the shoreline (shoreline)
Someone is waiting (waiting)
Wind that was falling is rising again

I hear the voices (voices)
I hear them calling (calling)
Every song was singing in the rain

Sailor, sailor beware
There are storm clouds
You must take care
Easy bring her around
Or the night will
Run you aground

I know...

In the ceiling
Over our heads
Fans and moving air
Spinning out the
Hours of darkness
Warning sound somewhere

Out on the shoreline (shoreline)
Someone is waiting (waiting)
The wind that was falling is rising again
I hear the voices (voices)
I hear them calling (calling)
Every song was singing in the rain

Sailor, sailor beware
There are storm clouds
You must take care
Easy bring her around
Or the night will
Run you aground

Morning
Here in the air
When you feel it
Know that you're there

Laying dark
Behind the scenes a
Madman at the screens

Laying dark
Behind the scenes a
Madman at the screens

Laying dark
Behind the scenes a
Madman at the screens

Dreaming...
Feeling the air...
Dreaming...
Seeing you there...



There are no ground staff in the empty corridors
Is no one sleeping?
No one awake?

I'd start an engine in the night
If only just to break the silence
That last intake of...
Air...

The clouds in the night as we breathe
Too late for even the night breathes to me

We can wait for dawn
To carry on
Then we can fly from here

I want to be the one
Who always gives you shelter
Finds you waitin'
Keep you warm

I want to be the one
Who's always there beside you
But we both must
Face the dawn...
Alone...

So cruel like the world that we leave
Too late for even the night breathes to me

We can wait for dawn
To carry on
Then we can fly from here

Only ghosts are in the empty corridors
They're all strangers
Never cared

I know them from some other life
When things were different
And we both were in the end

Turn yourself around (turn yourself around)
Turn your life around (turn your life around)
Turn your world around (turn your world around)
Turn this ship around (turn this ship around)

So turn your wheel around
I watch the sky

All defenses down
I watch the sky
I watch the sky



Dreaming
Seeing you there
See you sometime somewhere



Along the edge of this airfield
The old prop-shaft airliners stand
Altimeters reading zero
Formless memories lingering

Nights are cold on this airfield
I sit alone and watch the radar
Locked on the wavelength, caught in the beam
Falling slowly into the screen

Every day that you wait
Is one more that you've lost
When you wake up
I see you there
On display
Lights the final point of no return
Taking us there from here

And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
Into a sky that's clearing
Look back we'll dry the tears
For those once held so nearly
And love will never disappear

Along the edge of this airfield
The old prop-shaft airliners stand
Altimeters reading zero
Formless memories lingering
Lingering, lingering, lingering

And we can fly from here
Into a sky so clearly
Look back, we'll dry the tears
For those once held so nearly

And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)

And we can fly from here
On the understanding that we can fly

Everyday that you waste
Is one more that you've lost
On display
That's a final point of no return

Everyday that you waste
Is one more that you've lost
On display
That's a final point of no return



We can fly (we can fly)
We can fly (we can fly)

And we can fly from here
Into the sky that's clearing
Look back we'll dry the tears
For those once held so nearly

And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here (we can fly)
And we can fly from here

On the understanding that we can fly



My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

Looking for the mystery in the woman
Dancing with the teacher in the circle
Watching for the reasons we are going
Getting ready for the big bang
Everybody looking for that great connection
Somebody help me find that universal dream
Everybody watching, is something happening
See what I mean

Looking for the real man
Looking for the teacher
Dancing with the circle
Looking for the real world
Everybody knows where we're going to
Don't forget to leave good footprints behind
Never let the grass grow over your soul
Only time will tell, leave good footprints behind

I have seen the way 
The way is clear to save your love
High upon the sky
The forces come to break you free

Forgiving is what you have
Forgiving is what you see
Forgiving is what you know
Forgiving is all you are
I have seen the way
The way is clear beyond your soul

I have seen the way 
The way is clear to save your love
High upon the sky
The forces come to break you free
Forgiving is what you have
Forgiving is what you see
They say the soul has so many lifetimes
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

Only when you stop to listen
Only when you stop to see
Forgiving is what you have
Forgiving is what you see
Forgiving is what you know
Forgiving is all you are
I have seen the way
The way is clear to save your soul
I have seen the way
The way is clear beyond you soul
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world
My eyes see the coming revolution
My eyes see the glory of the world

Don't forget to leave good footprints behind
Don't forget to leave good footprints behind

You found folks treat you right
As long as you let them know
You've been ready to defend their right
Through doors that they oppose
But if it chokes you let it go
If it doesn't sound true to you
It's no business of yours

You can count friends on your fingers
Count 'em on your toes
If you leave you are a friend of all
Those friendships heaven knows
But there comes a time when your testimony
Will crumble like a rose
Let's have no pretense

It's all there
Friendships can never be forgotten
It's all there
True friends will never question you, you
And it's all there
In the stories we're about to read of a long time ago
And it's really always been there to let you know

There are times way back in history
Where valor overcame
The almighty tyrants of the past
Forgotten all but name
As the sons of righteous leaders
Bent on crushing nations
Thus believe the spirit just

And it's all there
Friendships can never be forgotten
In the end years
You've got to hold on to what you've got, what you've got
And it's all there
In the stories we're about to read of a long time ago
In the modern day around you let it show

You can see love deep in children's eyes
Feel 'em in the wind
You can reach the blessings of the innocence
On which we meet
You can guide love in the atmosphere
Arising from the source
You know the citizens of chance
Another citizen of choice

If you're mortal, be destroyed
Then immortal be the course



Now I've heard you singing
Dreaming that you know me well
Let me tell you far away
Looking down on you

If you know my spirit
Always shall you know me now
Singing is your pleasure
Looking down on you

Now I hear you singing
Saying that you know me well
Take me to your promise
New state of mind

Now I feel you sighing
Saying that you understand
Feeling all the power
Looking down on you

You know that I would be
The one who waits forever
You know that someday we will find
A way to share our love

Now I hear you singing
Dreaming that you know me well
Let me tell you far away
New state of mind



In the fountains of the Universe : Set time in accord
Sits the boychild Solomon :  Ever turning round and round
In the cities of the Southern Sky : Set points Universe
Dreams he of glory : Pulsating round and round
Future times will stand and clearly see : Highest dancing
Of the course of innocence : Drifting drifting

See it all
See it all
Till tomorrow
See it all
See it all
Till tomorrow

Future times will stand and clearly smile
Of the course of innocence

Dantalion will ride again : Raging forth underland
The course of evils standing straight : Grind to grind
Hot metal will abound the land : Churning out shout
As the form regards our blazing hand
Future times will stand and clearly see
Of the course of innocence 

One the word will enter all our hearts
Two the duel will alter them
Three jewels countenance divine away delight away
Four the fight to free the land
Five the islands of Arabia
Six the tears that separate
Six the tears that separate



This is a right
total opposition
I believe in you
can't you hear me
it doesn't change
how we hurt each other
when the road gets rough
can't you hear me

Too much riding on the rhythm
too much gliding by the range
you know all the indications
don't be afraid, afraid of letting go

Just give &amp; take
give what you have
I'll give it all to you
Give &amp; take
I've made up my mind
we've just got to see it through
make me the reason
your answer to love
as another day goes by
think about, think about it
some things just happen for love <i>[x2]</i>
some things just happen

Make the rhythm
don't break the energy
it's never too late
to make a turnaround
you've got to move
in all directions
I believe in you
what we're going though

I know you're so complicated
I know always making time
I see it takes you to the very edge
don't be afraid, afraid of letting go

<i>[chorus]</i>

Too much riding on the rhythm
too much gliding by the range
too much takes you to the very edge
don't be afraid, afraid of letting go

Just give &amp; take
give what you have
I'll give it all to you
give &amp; take
don't be afraid to let go
of the silence that hits you
just give &amp; take
get what you can
it's all that you can do

Just give &amp; take
don't take too much
give &amp; take
you gotta talk, talk, talk
reason to talk, talk, talk
get up, talk, talk, talk
out your system
talk, talk, talk
get out your system
talk, talk, talk

Give and take...



Standing here on sacred ground
Some days it's a mad world let it be
Words of promise fill the air, empty voices
How long have we waited?

And every time I hold your hand
You bring to me this promised land
I live for you, this promised land

Take me there and back again
Some days it's a sad world let it be
What's the point of looking for this power divine?
It's already in my changes

And every time I hear your voice
I realize I have the choice
To live again, I deserve this choice
To live again

Our heaven will be now
You are the song from the book of time
To realize what is yours is mine
We are meant to be
All because our love has always been
You are the centre of my day
You are my guide in every way
We were meant to be
All because our love has always been there
Giving me the light
Yes it's been there
Giving me the light

Second nature sings to me
Some days it's a dark world let it be
I define my right to be
I can follow those who've lost their vision

And every time I hold your hand
You redesign my promised land
I live for you, this promised land
I live for you

You are the song from the book of time
To realise what is yours is mine
We are meant to be
All because our love has always been
You are the centre of my day
You are my guide in every way
We were meant to be
All because our love has always been there
Giving me the light (Giving me the light)
Yes it's been there, giving me the light

You are the song from the book of time
To realise what is yours is mine
We are meant to be
All because our love has always been
You are the centre of my day
You are my guide in every way
We were meant to be
All because our love has always been there
Giving me the light
Yes it's been there giving me the light

Give love each day

Give love each day
Give love each day
Give love each day



Get the idea
Cross around the track
When you leap on the flank 
Of a thoroughbred racing chaser

Get the feel 
As the rhythm flows
Would you like to go 
And shoot the mountain masses?

And here you stand no taller than the grass seas
And should you really chase so hard
The truth of sport plays rings around you

Going for the one
Going for the one

Get in the way 
As the tons of water
Racing with you 
Crash into the rudders
Once at the start 
Can you gamble that
You really surely 
Really mean to finish

After seeing all your sense of fear diminish
As you treat danger as a pure connection
As you throw away all misconceptions

Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for-ward to

Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life

Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Roundabout, sounding out
Love me so

Now the verses I've sang 
Don't add much weight 
To the story in my head
So I'm thinking I should go and write a punchline

But they're so hard to find 
In my cosmic mind
So I think I'll take 
A look out of the window

When I think about you
I don't feel low
Should I really chase so hard?
The truth of sport plays rings around you

Going for the one
Going for the one
Going for-ward to 

Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life

Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Taking your time

Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling

Listen in time
Taken so high
To touch, to move
Listen to life

Touching, touch time
Travel, twilight
Taken so high
Taking your time

Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling

Turn on to love
Turnstile to one
Tender timing
Rocking, rolling

Moments decide...
Moments delight...
Moments invite...
Talk about sending love...
Love...
Love...
Love...
Love



Once a book attracted my attention not too long ago
It said the future would reveal a way
The reading book which pleasured me reflected days we dream about
And now it seems those days are drawing near

And have you seen the order and the parting of the older ways
The sky has never been so high before
The minstrel tunes his pleasure songs, the sounds proclaiming the new age
It's time the news was free for all to hear

Have you seen the order and the coming of the golden age
When all our hearts will know the everlasting days
Love will pour throughout the land as never known before
The meeting of the ways

Is the dawn
Is the dawning of the golden age

You and me time feeling in the morning light
Getting it together, does it feel right?

Let us be together in the morning light
Let us be together in the dawning light

Let it through
Let it through
Let it through

Have you seen the glory and the coming of the golden age
When all our hearts will know the everlasting days
Love will pour throughout the land as never known before
The meeting of the ways

On this day
On this day of days

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la our <i>[?]</i> is falling



Harold Land with a wave of his hand,
said goodbye to all that,
He paid his bills, stopped the Milk, and then put on his hat,
He tried to say his last farewells as quickly as he could,
Promising that he would return, but doubted that he would,
doubted that he would.

Now he's marching soldiers in the rain
as on to war they rode.
A long thin line of human mind,
damnation as their load!
In the mud in coldness dark he'd shiver out his fear,
What disappointing sights he'd seen instead of one's so dear
instead of one's so dear

Going home, He's going home to the land he loved so well,
Going home, he fought for two whole years he never fell,
He's going home, He's going home.
Harold Land with a wave of his hand stood sadly on the stage,
Clutching red ribbons from a badge but he didn't look his age,
only two years had passed between his leaving home and back,
He had lost his love and youth while leading the attack
Leading the attack

In conversation it could be said,
Well after war your heart is dead,
Well it's not hard to understand,
There is no heart in Harold Land.



Love comes to you and you follow
Lose one on to the Heart of the Sunrise
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with its arms all around me

Lost on a wave and then after
Dream on on to the Heart of the Sunrise
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with so many around me
lost in the city

Lost in their eyes as you hurry by
Counting the broken ties they decide
Love comes to you and then after
Dream on on to the Heart of the Sunrise
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with its arms all around me
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with so many around me
I feel lost in the city

Lost in their eyes as you hurry by
Counting the broken ties they decided

Straight light moving and removing
SHARPNESS of the colour sun shine
Straight light searching all the meanings of the song
Long last treatment of the telling that
relates to all the words sung
Dreamer easy in the chair that really fits you

Love comes to you and then after
Dream on on to the Heart of the Sunrise
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with its arms all around me
SHARP-DISTANCE
How can the wind with so many around me
I feel lost in the city



Hearing - Talking - Yes I - Love you

Set your heart sail on the river
Look around you as you drift downstream
Pouring souls into the ocean
Take account of all you've seen

Hearing

One people - Together
Freedom for today
So easy the future
So see the children's way

Love me
Teach me
Know me

One people - Together
Freedom for today
Tomorrow forever
So see the people's way

Many moons cascade one river
They light from side to side
As we cross in close proximity
Like rivers our hearts entwine
How we talk - How we teach our children
How we move - We direct our eyes
All the senses tuned discovery
As and as and when our hearts decide
Be ready now - Be ye circle
Be the central force ye life
As the game extends the cycle
Be ready to move

One heart's for love
One's for giving
Two hearts are better

See the searching...
See the people...

Out in the darkness I'm soul searching;
Did you find what we had lost?
All this time I've got to thinking about the promises;
How long this energy of Winter?
How many times could we never love?
How many times is time enough?

All the foolish notions: When we'll die that's all that is.
We can never really understand the broken promises.
All along we run together (Remember?)
All along we run as one (Remember?)
When you find a perfect union, you've got to follow it.

Stop that reason! Get the answer!
You've got to stop that thinking out loud! (Get the answer!)
Go where your heart tells you to (Get the answer!)
You're not that innocent! You've been around!

Got to be right; got it coming to you.
How many times is time enough? (Who we love?)
Your time is just beginning out of all where we came from.

Holding on: This point receiving; there it is!
Holding on: Can you remember?
Holding on: Was it ever like this?
Holding on: It's the most important thing.

It was the first time that I saw you
It was the first time that I knew
Out of all my disbelieving,
Holding on, I was holding you.



Justice to the left of you
Justice to the right
Speak when you are spoken to
Don't pretend you're right
This life's not for living
It's for fighting and for war
No matter what the truth is
Hold on to what is yours

Jigsaw puzzle traitors
Set to spill the beans
Constitution screw up
Shattering the dreams
Blood flows in the desert
Dark citadels burning too
Watch! Look over your shoulder
This one is strictly for you

Hold on - Hold on
Wait maybe the answer's
Looking for you

Hold on - Hold on
Wait! Take you time
Think it through
Yes! I can make it through

Hold on - Hold on
Sunshine shine on through
Hold on - Hold on
Sunshine shine on you

See it through

Talk the simple smile
Such platonic eye
How they drown in incomplete capacity
Strangest of them all
When the feeling calls
How we drown in stylistic audacity
Charge the common ground
Round and round and round
We living in gravity

Shake - We shake so hard
How we laugh so loud
When we reach
We believe in eternity

I believe in eternity

Hold on - Hold on
Wait - Take your time
See it through
Hold on - Hold on
Wait - Maybe a chance
Is looking for you

Sunshine shine on through

Sunshine shine on through
Sunshine shine on you

Hold on - Hold on
Hold on - Hold on

Sunshine - Shine on - Shine on you
Sunshine - Shine on through
Sunshine - Shine on - Shine on through
Sunshine - Shine on you

Sunshine - Shine on - Shine on you
Sunshine - Shine on through

Sunshine - Shine on - Shine on through
Sunshine - Shine on you
Hold on - Hold on
Wait - Take your time
See it through
Hold on - Hold on
Wait - Maybe the answer's looking for you



Holy lamb
See the world we started
Is it so low again
Like a light that's lost upon the stage
So the more it shines, it goes away

Surely then
See the curtain rising to show us once again
All the magic of the earth and the skies
See the more we find
The more we realize

That every time
See the laws of nature keep telling us like a friend
It's the spirit of emotion dancing to the wind
High above
High above
So sure inspired again

I can tell a new story now
Can we see through this mask of uncertainty
Surely now
How can it be so hard when all there is to know
Don't be afraid of letting go
It takes a loving heart
To see and show
This love
For our own ecology

Hold the light
Hold the light
Out of love we'll come a long long glorious way
At the start of every day
A child begins to play
And all we need to know
Is that the future is a friend of yours and mine



Nothing can take us far enough emotion
Far enough together
As the light shines so bright
Bright enough to let us in

Nothing can bridge our souls' devotion
Fast enough together
As the power proves you right
Right enough to let you begin 

So many displaced among the future dreamers 
Realized their doubles
Took a new step
A question of origin

Only in the recent past
Seekers fought to realize
Skyward shone like beacons 
A question of origin

Ten thousand millions flee
To the westward light
The dreamers represent
This arc of peace

As the poets entranced
The anchor redeemed
Secrets of science
The history of the future
Was surely made

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Home is our world

Nothing can take us far enough emotion
Far enough together
As the light shines so bright
Bright enough to let us in

Nothing can bridge our souls devotion
Fast enough together
As the power proves you right
Right enough to let you begin 

Speak so fast to the prophets of the living
Looking for the signs
Spanning out the centuries
Search for truth

Ancient ones, they watch and listen
Carry our wishes
Took upon themselves to guide us
Through the endless skies

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Our hope is our world, our life

I have seen the passion
That's in the hope that everyone
Will find their way into the secret
Of the home of your heart

Living within the vision
Within the power, beyond belief
We see that hate destroys the soul
Of anyone who tries to teach it

I have seen the dream
That's in your heart
That's in your eyes
To bring you closer to the one

It's what keeps us so alive
It's what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life

Just what keeps us so alive
Just what makes us realize
Our home is our world, our life
Home is our world, our life

Send, ascending to the secrets
All is pure and clear to resolve
Nothing can change us now

Send, ascending to the future
Nothing can ever change us now 
We follow the sun 
We follow the sun
We follow the sun

Truth is a simple place
Here for us all to see
Reach as it comes to you 
As it comes to me
As I will always need you inside my heart

Peace is a word we teach
A place for us all to reach
Sing as it sings to you
As it sings to me
As I will always need you inside my heart



In the dark while the obvious isn't clear
Can't believe just what can interfere

Remember what has been achieved
Keep tryin' it's the hour of need

What's the cost?
Can the end justify the means?
There's a need so many mouths to feed

Remember what has been achieved
Keep tryin' it's the hour of need
Still hoping we can succeed
In this hour of need

Words unwritten
Mistrust suspicion
Stuck in this wilderness

For everyone water to drink
Either we sink or swim

Am I waking to this magic
Am I seeing, all is human,
Human after all...

I wanna be inside your heart
Are you ready
I wanna love forever
Are you thinking
I wanna be inside your heart
What I'm thinking
I wanna know you're with me.

Highways, starways, many ways
To be open tonight.
High time, look inside your life.
I am waiting.

I am waiting; are you ready?
I am waiting; can you hear me?
Can you hear me?

I happened in the water.
The heaven will fall.
The break in the water.
The secret birth.

Said she loves me; I believe her.
Waited lifetimes, say this to you.

I wanna be inside your heart
Are you ready
I wanna love forever
Are you thinking
I wanna be inside your heart
What I'm thinking
I wanna know you're with me.

Highways, starways, many ways
To be open tonight.
High time, look inside your life.
I am waiting.
Say you need me, I'm yours.
Say you need me, just because.

(It's our freedom...)
It's our freedom, hear me now.
We are made to be here now.
We'll be waiting for the word
As the healing of the world.
Make me promises, to be true,
All my life my world is you.

I am waiting; are you ready?
Are you ready?
I am waiting; can you hear me?
Can you hear me?



I can lift you with my heart
Give you meaning every day 
Cannot live without your truth

And be the true me 
To be the true you

Pick the flowers from your floor
Put them in your arms for you my love
Realise my life and more

Say you will 'n' then

Take me home
Make me clear
It feels so much better
Take me home
To this heart of hearts

If only you knew
You caught me when I was falling
Yes you caught me when I was falling fast

And only you knew
You answered me when I was calling you
You saw me when I was dreaming you
Into my life 

Everyone who looks at you
Sees the loving in your every move
You're the healing of the soul

To be the true you
To be the true me

I will be your strength all time
Ever wishing you this love and more
Forever be your guiding song

Say you will and then

Take me home 
Make me clear
To feel so much better
In this life 
In your heart of hearts

If  only you knew
How you caught me when I was falling
Yes you caught me when I was falling fast

And only you knew
You answered me when I was calling you
You saw me when I was dreaming you
Into my life

When I feel the hurt in so many peoples' lives
I take a deep breath and think of your smile your eyes

When I hear the sadness of this earthtime
Then I take a deep breath and know that you understand
That you understand     

And only you knew
How you caught me when I was falling fast
Caught me when I was falling fast

If  only you knew
How you answered me when I was calling you
You saw me when I was dreaming you

If  only you knew
Yes you caught me when I was falling fast
You caught me when I was falling
Into your life



Jacaranda
Help me out tomorrow
Jacaranda
Don't want to be alone
Keep falling over
A spell that brings me sorrow
Give and take
I shouldn't be afraid
So you give me this big story
It wakes me every day
The challenge is to chase the sounds
Just to break away

And I'm running
Running
Yes I'm running
A simple peace
Just can't be found
Waste another day
Blasting all their lives away
I've heard the thunder
Underground
Tunneling away
At the very soul of man

And I'm running
Yes I'm running
I'm running
Through a new world

There is the heart of millions
Seen as a godsend to us
There stands our future
There can be no denying
Simple as A B C D
There stands our children's lives

All in the sharp step
As one together
All in all we race
As one
This time

A simple peace
Just can't be found
Waste another day
Blasting all their lives away
I've heard the thunder
Underground
Tunneling away
At the very soul of man
At the very soul of man

And I'm running
Running
I'm running

See through science
Part of a back door
A door made up of doors
To an endless time
To a new world
Run

There in the heart of millions
Seen as a godsend to us
There stands our future
There can be no denying
Simple as A B C D
There stands our children's lives

All in the sharp step
As one together
All in all we race
As one
This time

Hear this voice
Now and forever
This time, brothers in time
Is it hard to take
Take this coice
Is it hard to find
Now and forever
This fire brothers of fire
Hard to find

As it kicks so hard
Hard to find
As it kicks on time
As it kicks on time

There in the heart of millions
Seen as a godsend to us
There stands our future
There can be no denying
Simple as A B C D
As it kicks so
As it kick so
As it kick so
There in the heart of millions
Seen as a godsend to us

All in a sharp step
As one together
All in all we race
as one
this time



Deeper than every ocean 
Deeper than every river 
That's what your presence brings to me 

Revealing the words I listen 
Seeing you in my silence 
Learning I'm with you constantly 
As I was before 

If we were flowers 
We would worship the sun 
So why not now? 
This high is shining brightly 
Brighter than before 

As the door was open wide 
There inside was a diamond chair 
Where I sat when I was young 
I wrote down the words 

Only when the young at heart 
Can enter the real world 
This chance I've waited for 
For you to see 

If I had chances I would spend them with you 
To hold you close and let your love surround me 
Deeper than before 

(Deeper than every ocean) 
And I know this love is real 
(Deeper than every river) 
Realize this is meant to be 
That's what your eyes they say to me 
You are listening to how I feel 
So expectedly 
(Brighter than every morning) 
From the ocean to the sky 
(Beautiful as the sunset) 
Every river to the sea 
Nature surrounds me constantly 
We can hear love constantly 
This is for you and me 

Turn around and come deeper now 
So what happens when I touch you there 
You feel the words roll over you 
Thinking of the better scenes 
The memories 
As everybody else just 
Hasn't got the time 
To help you anymore 

'Cause if the reason for 
The things that pleasure us 
To please ourselves 
Not pressure us 
To give our ego 
Some pleasure time 

Can you imagine 
Any reason 
To know you're only fooling yourself 
And then you'll understand why 
You'll understand why 

So if we choose to realize 
All existence is a dream 
This perfect resume to you 
From me 

Just had a tough time with magic 
The death of ego 
The moon 
It was just coming through 

Send me such a good time 
In a letter form, tell me 
The pleasure, no pressure 
Pure imagination in a metaphoric dream 

I get amazed like a true beginner 
I get amazed like a true believer 
I get amazed when I see you there 
And I come alive 

I believe I'm a true beginner 
I believe I'm a true beginner 
In your arms I can see it all 
I can see it all 

If we were flowers 
We would worship the sun 
So why not now? 
This light is burning brightly 
This light is burning brightly 
Brighter than before 
Brighter than before 
Brighter than before 
Brighter than before 

Turn around and remember that 
When it gets so low 
As you finally hit the ground 

Turn around and remember that 
Now I'm standing tall 
Standing on my sacred ground 

Turn around and remember that 
When it gets so low 
As you finally hit the ground 

Turn around and remember that 
Now you're standing tall 
Standing on sacred ground 
Standing on sacred ground 
Standing on sacred ground



Like a stair reach up
As moonlight, as of fire
In the middle of desire
By the master light that sees us in the wind
We carry on, on and on

Like coldness in the wind
That would change life's true desire
Seeing winter, summer, autumn, spring again

In the quiet of morning mist I dream of you
In the tallest tower I think I always will

Tall death that haunted me so
Can't find no well design
Can't help it on your own

Surely time will come
When the talents of a lifetime spent with you
Surely makes the best of chance

Like the wind can tell us
For what is true is life
Days gone by
Days gone by
Days gone by

We meet by the tower of true love
We sit beside us in the rain
Smiling with the raindrops clear

Like the sun can tell us
For what is true is life
For what is true is life
For what is true is life



Memories, how they fade so fast
Look back, that is no escape
Tied down, now you see too late
Lovers, they will never wait

I am a camera

Take heart, I could never let you go
And you, always let the feeling show
Love us all, how you never broke your heart
You lose them
If you feel the feeling start

I am a camera, camera, camera
I am a camera, camera, camera
I am a camera, camera, camera

And you, may find time will blind you
This to just remind you
All is meant to be

There, by the waterside
Here, where the lens is wide
You and me
By the sea
Taken in tranquility

Taken, taken so easily
To pass into glass reality
Transform, to transfer, to energy

Taken, taken, so easily
To pass into glass reality
Transformer, transferring energy



Something not so superficial
Like something I can really do without
Need a hand to hold onto
Help me understand

What's the point of reparation now?
You've just got to make that beat somehow
Into the storm

All the stories you've been telling
You must know someday they'll find you out
Through this life you've been propelling
Now you're spinning out

Time to make your reparations now
You've just got to make that leap somehow
Come on and make it now
Into the storm

Armies of angels are starting to fall
Bathed in the light at the break of the dawn
Armies of angels are leading me on
Take me away from the heart of the storm
Take me away
Take me away

One thing learned from all these years
As stupid now as we were at first
Maybe that's the way it goes
When you try to change the world

Sending pointless invitations out
You always knew what this was all about
Somewhere a fire is breaking out
Into the storm

Armies of angels are starting to fall
Bathed in the light at the break of the dawn
Armies of angels are leading me on
Take me away from the heart of the storm
Take me away
Take me away

And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here
And we can fly from here



I see you la la la la la la I see you
I see you la la la la la la I see you
I see you la la la la la la I see you
Sun smiling through the cave of your hair
Wind washing tulips out of space sitting there
I love you
At your door second floor first world war
I love you
Who listens
tell your friend I'm aware that she care
who listens
Green specks bright spiraling out in the sky
catch my eye turn my head have to look don't know why
I see you
Everywhere behind your hair over there
I see you
I see you though your eyes can tell lies I sympathize,
I see you
Sun smiling through the cave of your hair
Wind washing tulips out of space sitting there

You can fool yourself
You can cheat until you're blind
You can cut your heart
It can happen

You can mend the wires
You can feed the soul apart
You reach
It can happen to you
It can happen to me
It can happen to everyone eventually

It's a constant fight
A constant fight
You're pushing the needle to the red
Black and white
Who knows who's right
No substitute you're born you're dead
Fly by night
Created out of fantasy
Our destinations call

Look up - Look down
Look out - Look around
Look up - Look down
There's a crazy world outside
We're not about to lose our pride

It can happen to you
It can happen to me
It can happen to everyone eventually

As you happen to say
It can happen today
As it happens
It happens in every way

This world I like
We architects of life
A song a sigh
Developing words that linger
Through fields of green through open eyes
This for us to see

Look up - Look down
Look out - Look around
So look up - Look down
There's a crazy world outside
We're not about to lose our pride

It can happen to you
It can happen to me
It can happen to everyone eventually

As you happen to say
It can happen today
As it happens
It happens in every way

As you happen to see
It will happen to be
Nothing happens to nowhere and nowhere

Baby you'll need a replacement
Baby I'm moving on
I've been in one place far too long
Its time that I was gone
I know I said when we started
Time would ease along
We were on a road to nowhere
Speed of sound

Our wait blows over
Punks fade away
As you sit by your window
Holding tears at bay

Its over
Will you still feel me though I'm not there
Its over
Where will you go when the lights are low
Its over
What will you do when the nights are long
Its over
Its over for you and me

I've come to tell you
Something I need to say
Its been coming for sometime
Never happened today
All those times I loved you
I really loved you
We need a new face
A brand new day

Its over
Where will you go when the lights are low
Its over
Will you still feel me though I'm not there

Now I'll be movin'
I won't leave you a key
I'm so near as our memory
And that's all we need
Our wait blows over
Punks fade away
As you sit by your window
Holding tears at bay

Its over
Will you still feel me though I'm not there
Its over
Where will you go when the lights are low
Its over
What will you do when the nights are long
Its over
Its over for you and me



Golden forest golden lake
Sanctuary, state of grace
I will find reason a place to begin
It will be a good day

Beginning is one place I've been before
Watching the sunrise on the silver shores
Setting me free again leading the way
It will be a good day

Sometimes I forget
How mighty this earth
Astounding winter skies
Truth is in birth
Peace that it brings to me, my naked eyes
Be a good day

Make me believe again
Making me free again
Making me see again

Golden mountains golden seas
A thousand reasons singing to me 
Alive to this message 
Realising it all 
Be a good day 

Learning to listen learning to see
Learning is power making me free
Free to believe again in my human side
Giving me good reason 
Giving me good reason 

(Come tomorrow)
Make me believe again
(Destiny)
(Take the river)
Making me free again 
(To the sea)

(Come tomorrow)
Making me see again 
(Will be free)

Like a river

Time feels so much closer now
You are with me, so real

We make our own heaven
Clear through the sky
The making of reason for you and I
I sing of each season
Making us feel
This will be a good day
This will be a good day

(Come tomorrow)
Make me believe again
(Destiny)

(Take the river )
Making me free again
(To the sea)
(Come tomorrow)
Making me see again 
(Destiny)
Like a river to the sea

Make me believe again
Making me free again
(Come tomorrow)
Making me see again 
(Destiny)

(Take the river)
Making me free again 
(To the sea)

(Come tomorrow)
Making me see again 
(Take the river)
(Come tomorrow)
(Destiny)
(Take the river)
(To the sea)

So satisfied I'm on my way

I've seen all good people turn their heads each day
So satisfied I'm on my way...



I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life
I would have waited forever - I would have given you everything I had
I would have waited forever - There's no question, no question at all

So true in the prize, would you wait for me?
All because you got burned, so you took what you needed.
Some will always turn away, say it's reason enough;
It's another game of exploration.
Something calls at reverse and it comes to you;
Experience everything as it comes true.

So - It will be then
Change - It will happen
See - That we feel it
All - Is completed.

Don't you want the world to stop short of giving?
Anytime of night or day, the magic things you love.
Everybody hurts when you shout, when you walk away;
Talk about it according to you.

I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life
I would have waited forever - To give you everything I had
I would have waited forever - There's no question about it at all

So inbetween the perfect flame of you, this love will never let you down.
Just take it as it comes, for everything will come around.

You put your hand up: stop the flow of where you're going to;
It's another game called exploration.
How we imagine everything that we think we're going through;
It's another reason to make the break.
Everyone will move with you now to the riverside;
Experience everything, but go with the landslide.

I would have waited forever - For you to return into my life
I would have waited forever - To give you everything I had
I would have waited forever - No question in my body and soul
Forever...



I can feel no sense of measure
No illusions as we take
Refuge in young man's pleasure
Breaking down the dreams we make
Real

One down one to go
Another town and one more show
Downtown they're giving away
But she never came back

No phone can take your place
You know what I mean
We have the same intrigue
As a court of kings

Ah leave it
Ah leave it
Two down there you go
McArthur Park in the driving snow
Uptown they're digging it out
Better lay your claim

Get home you're not alone
You just broke out of the danger zone
Be there to show your face
On another dreamy day

Ah leave it
Ah leave it

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven
Ah leave it

Ah leave it

I can feel no sense of measure
No illusions as we take
Refuge in young man's pleasure
Breaking down the dreams we make
Real

Ah leave it
Ah leave it

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

One down one to go
Another town and one more show

One down one to go
Another town and one more show
Ah leave it

Ah leave it

Ah leave it
Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad
Hello hello heaven

Goodbye goodbye goodbye bad

Leave it



All the poems of my neighbors
That drift across the sand
Are just the tendrils of a vast
But gentle pluck which they command

The headdress of a goddess
You wore the night we came
Is only one small symptom
And really not to blame

You're riding a tiger
Riding a tiger

Heaven sent immortals
Waged upon the wall
And likewise all the missiles
Shot to make them fall

Everlasting movie
Picture into frame

Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger

All of the beaches
Into the sky
Into the beach of sun-glass goodbye

Key grip was crying
This boy was made
Here in the shelter
Whole unafraid
We were there

Follow the road that leads to the sun
Who formed our leader he is the one
Who will offer the silence
You must beware
Using the page that no one can share

Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger

Out of the morning
Into the day
Onto the evening
Nowhere to stay

We were always together
Always the same
Into the future
No one to blame

Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger
Riding a tiger



Look around - Got no place to stay.
God I hate this town, depending on the day.
You lift me up, you lift me down - Alright, OK.

While I got no life, I got no hope;
I'm falling in love.
Help me through the fight;
Help me with tonight - I'm calling.

What to do I find it hard to know;
Lord, the walk is not the one I chose...

Lift me up and turn me over;
Lead me on into the dawn.
Take me to the highest mountain;
Tie me up, love in a storm.
Have you decided on my fortune?
Facing the future in your eyes,
With your imperial behaviour
We fight amidst the battle cries.

Open doors - They may be closed to me;
The fire's still burning in my heart...

What to do I find it hard to know;
I want to turn my life around...



What you gonna do when the lightning strikes and hits you
Who ya gonna call for the secret of stealing the world
Swimming in this ocean of words on your new cellphone
Diving for the wisdom of pearls in your eyes
Come on

What ya gonna do when the lightning strikes and hits you
How ya gonna laugh when the joker forgets his lines 
Stepping off a cloud into space whatever greets you
Show me how you got this award for being alive

Waking up is waking to the power
Dancing up is dancing till the dawn
Talk talk talk will always get you someplace
Shake it up 'n' shake me till I'm done
Shake it up now!

She ay... Do wa bap
She ay... Do wa bap
She ay... Do wa bap
She ay... Do wa bap

Who ya gonna call when the power
Begins to chase you
Spinning out of shape now you're learning to live again
Fastening your seatbelt tonight it could get jumpy

Showing me the good 'n' that 
Life is not in vain

Take take take 'n' take me thru the lightning
Walk don't talk me always on the run 
Ride it out until you get the picture
Shake it up and let me get me some
Let me get me some

Eya he say touch it together
Touching my spirit touching my feeling
Eya he say touch it together
Touching my spirit touching my feeling
Eya he say coming together
Touching my spirit touching my feeling
Eya he say coming together
Touching my spirit touching my feeling

Talk, talk, talk, keep moving 'round in circles
Moving till the moon is on the run
Take me take me take me to the new day
Take me out and let me get me some

Take take take and dance me thru the lightning
Moving to the left 'n' to the sun... ya ya ya

Help me get me some... ya
Help me get me some... come on

Ooh ya... ooh ya... ooh ya... ooh ya
Ooh ya... ooh ya... ooh ya



Long distance run around
Long time waiting to feel the sound
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred

Cold summer listening
Hot colour melting the anger to stone
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred

Long distance run around
Long time waiting to feel the sound
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred

Cold summer listening
Hot colour melting the anger to stone
I still remember the dream there
I still remember the time you said goodbye
Did we really tell lies
Letting in the sunshine
Did we really count to one hundred

Looking for the sunshine



Looking around me
There's not so much in life that I miss
Things that I can't see
I'll touch and I'll feel then I'll kiss
Then I saw you standing there
With a smile I couldn't share
Just looking around, everywhere.
Tunes that I can't hear,
would take me for a while my smile
Fares that are too dear
I'd rather walk out another smile
Then I heard a tune so right
It was in the light of night
just listening around everywhere
All the things I've wanted to do
take so much time to get around to you
just reach out and catch and hold on
having trails of dust and lust but never even lying or trying
just keep on moving and never dying.
Smiles that I don't see
I'll make them up as I go on
Laughs that just can't be
I'll make and laugh at everyone
Then I saw you in your place
with a laugh upon your face
Just looking around everywhere
Looking around with my feet on the ground full of words and
of sound bring smiles all around
Satisfy me with your words that can be full of sound and I'll
see I'm just looking around.



I won't sleep again until I sleep again with you 
I won't dream again until I dream again with you

One look in your eyes and I see the light shining through 
I truly believe in the magic of all that you do

Give me hope.....When I need it
Give me peace.....When I feel it
Give me life.....When I breathe it
Give me dreams....Keep me dreaming

One look in your eyes and I know it's right for me and you
Feel the love shine.....Do you feel the love shine.....
1234567 all good people

Your flame is the fire that bums in the night guiding me
through
Drawn out of the darkness and into the light you bring me to
Give me hope......When I need it
Give me peace.....When I feel it
Give me life.....When I breathe it
Give me dreams......Keep me dreaming

One look in your eyes and I know it's right for me and you

Do you feel the love shine......Feel the love that shines

Give me life.......When I breathe it
Give me dreams.....Keep me dreaming

It was the first time candlelight, something happens in
your life
It's the dance we all go through, bring it in now, bring it in
true, bring it in fast
Bring it right through right through
Feel the love shine



You wanna get close to me
The feeling so clear
But I need some time to see
Vision through my tear
You wanna get next to me
I need your intrusion
I don't need to be
Blinded by confusion

Here is my heart
Waiting for you
Here is my soul
I eat at chez nous

Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way
Love will find a way for me and you

Love will find a way
Love will find a way
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

So you want to get over me
And that's how you feel
Everything you want to be
Seems so unreal
I want to be all of you
And that's the confusion
It's so hard for me
To draw a conclusion

Here is my heart
Waiting for you
Here is my soul
I eat at chez nous

Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Love will find a way
If you want it to
Love will find a way
Love will find a way

Love will find a way
I believe that there's a way
If you want it to
Will love find a way
Love will find a way
Will love find a way
Love will find a way



<i>[Part I]</i>

Run down a street
Where the glass shows
That summer has gone
Age, in the doorways
Resenting the pace of the dawn.
All of them standing in line
All of them waiting for time.
From time, the great healer,
The machine-Messiah
Is born.

Cables that carry the life
To the cities we build
Threads that link diamonds of life
To the satanic mills
Ah, to see in every way
That we feel it every
Day, and know that
Maybe we'll change
Offered the chance
To finally unlearn our lessons
And alter our stance.

<i>[Part II]</i>

Friends make their way into systems of chance
<i>[reply - friends make their way of escape into systems of chance]</i>
Escape to freedom I need to be there
Waiting and watching, the tables are turning
I'm waiting and watching
I need to be there.

I care to see them walk away
And, to be there when they say
They will return.

Machine, Messiah
The mindless
Search for a higher
Controller
Take me to the fire
And hold me
Show me the strength of your
Singular eye.

<i>[Part III]</i>

History dictating symptoms of ruling romance
Claws at the shores of the water upon which we dance
All of us standing in line
All of us waiting for time
To feel it, all the way
And to be there when they
Say they know that
Maybe we'll change
Offered the chance
To finally unlearn our lessons
And alter our stance.

Machine, machine Messiah.
Take me into the fire

Hold me, machine Messiah
And show me
The strength of your singular eye.



I will be there said my friend of a distant life
Covered in greens of a golden age, set in stone
Follow me "he sounded of dreams supreme" follow me
Drifting within the glow and the after-glow of the eve

And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame

Sacred ships do sail the seventh age

Cast off your garments of fear, replace them with love
Most of all play with the game of the age
Highest of places remain all as one with you
Giving us light and the freedom of the day

...

And if that firelight, I could match the inner flame

Sacred ships do sail the seventh age
And have always been here

Celestial travelers have always been here with us
Set in the homes of the Universe we have yet to go
Countless expansions will arrive and flow inside of us
My friend, he of fantasy, dancing with the spirit of the age



Days that we speak
I believe that you are right
Shouldn't chase the demons and the phantoms of the night

Some treat as lovers
Some treat as slaves
This fusion of insight is all that we imagine

Speak to me clearly
You're the magnet to my soul
I get so distracted to reason with it all
Like the faithful
I'm clinging to the edge of every world
Spinning in creation
So afraid to let my feelings really show

Teach me to teach me
How the keys unlock the door
As we open it we surrender, holding hands with many more

There's a feeling that's coming
There's a feeling so real
To justify, to magnify, to realize that everything is love

Now, after all the love you have
You can always get it back
Knowing how you really see
Knowing it will come to you
Knowing that it can really be

Magnificate, magnification
Magnificate, magnification
First you're smaller being alive
Growing taller learn to survive
Magnificate, magnification
Magnificate, magnification
First you're smaller being alive
Growing taller learn to survive

Perception of living
I realize I'm not alone
The rings that divide us
Break again upon the stone
I will show you a necklace
Where the pearls would all be lost
Without the thread between together
This would be the golden thread of trust

Speak to me, teach me
Magnify the truth you are
Waiting for the rebeginning birth of every star

A symbol is planted
On the brow of every child
To justify, to magnify
To realize that everything is love

Now giving all the love you have now
You will always get it back now
Giving all the love you have now
You will always get it back
Giving all the love you have
Giving all the love

Magnificate, magnification
Magnificate, magnification
First you're smaller being alive
Growing taller learn to survive



Why the eagle flies
When the wind blows in his eyes
And he goes nowhere just to feel good

You don't know the reason
Our love is like the seasons
Breaking down and building up again

Why you hold me up
When I feel like falling down
Is the love you have that makes me feel good

Ah, you make it easy, take it slow
Well, I was hurtin' inside and you gave me a second chance
Ah, you take it easy when you let it go
I was hurtin' inside

Time rides all alone
When you're left back on your own
But I know, you're always there to lean on

Look beyond your <i>[?]</i>
And you'll find my love in check
It's all the love I have, love I give to you

Ah, you make it easy, take it slow
Well, I was hurtin' inside and you gave me a second chance
Ah, you take it easy when you let it go
I was hurtin' inside

Why the eagle flies
When the wind blows in his eyes
And he goes nowhere just to feel good

Time rides all alone
When you're left back on your own
But I know you're always there to lean on

You don't know the reasons
Our love is like the seasons
Breaking down and building up again

Ah, you make it easy, take it slow
Well, I was hurtin' inside and you gave me a second chance
Ah, you take it easy, when you let it go
I was hurtin' inside

Ah, you make it easy, take it slow
Well, I was hurtin' inside and you gave me a second chance
Ah, you take it easy when you let it go
I was hurtin' inside



I am the man in the moon
And I hope to shine upon you very soon
Waiting in the night 
To bathe you all in moonlight
I am the man
I am the man in the moon

Silently revolving 
Wandering through the heavens above 
On my own

Round and round and round I go
When I stop no one will know

I am a creature of the night
And I hope to come and shed a little light
Although the universe our teacher 
I remain the central feature
I am the man
I am the man in the moon

Round and round and round I go
When I stop no one will know

Silently revolving 
Wandering through the heavens above 
On my own

I am the man in the moon



Don't forget to seek out the world that you want to stake out
Actions speak much louder than words
And you get to realize 
Just as long as you have control, holding the fire
Just as long as you keep control, this point of your desire
Wait as it will all come to you
Feel it as a mutual response
You get the heaven you like
You get the heaven
You get the heaven you need
You get to heaven now
Just as long as you bring the power from the inside
Just as long as you hold the key from the inside
Ascend and create
Ascend and create
Ascension

They will bring you rain
They will move the sky
They will give you light
It will live you long
Thru' the eyes of child
Through the song of songs
It will bring the moon 
It will transfer you
Whole, pushing for the time to call
Dancing on the moon, giving it out

In the night of nights
It will shine for you
With the wings of flight
They will make it thru'
Through the eyes of child and the test of song
It will comfort you 
It will make you feel
Whole, looking for the chance to call
Making your world, independently
Whole, watching for the place to run
Dancing, dancing, move

We will make it right 
We will dance for you
On this night of nights
They will make it thru'
Through the eyes of child and the wish you are
As the thought that comes from a distant star
Whatever thought you have
Can become a new dream
For the perfect stance
Take you there and back again
And you believe you are
Independently, Whole
Waiting for the signs, Whole
Reaching for the foresight shown 
Whole, dancing for the moon, dancing for the light
Whole, pushing for the mind drive, drive
Dancing for the Earth, dancing for the light
Whole
Dancing for the light

They will bring the rain
They will make it right
It will transfer you, each and every night
With their wings of hope, they will cover you
They will make it right, they will shine for you
With their golden wings, close around your soul
It will count for you, it will make you whole
Thru' the eyes of child, and the song of songs
It will make you move, it will transfer you

And so it comes to this now
When you walk into the bliss that
Holds down the fire 
As pleasure will devine
So close so let your heart enter
So come and let your heart enter this
So close and let yourself lose control
Heaven help the love that you send
Heaven has the love you send, free

Whole, watching for the time to call
Dancing in the light, making it right
Dancing, dancing, whole
Waiting for the signs, whole
Reaching for the sight to show
Whole, independently, whole
Pushing for the mind drive, drive
Dancing on the Earth, dancing in the light

They will bring the rain, they will shine the light
Understanding this, it can come tonight
For the love of love and the answers to
It begins with me, it begins with you
Whole, pushing for the time to call
Looking for the sign, making it right
Dancing, dancing, whole
Waiting for the time to call
Dancing in the harmless sun
Entering the mind drive

Don't forget to seek out the world that you want to stake out
Actions speak much louder than words
And you get to realise 
Just as long as you have control, holding the fire
Just as long as you get to keep, this point of your desire
Wait as it will come to you
Feel it as a mutual response
You get the heaven you like
You get to heaven
You get the heaven you need
You get to heaven now



Hold on to the miracle of life...

Secret lives of oceans been washed away like mud.
You don't want my devotion;
You'd rather be washed in blood.
Can we turn away from this open anger?
Counting all the prey
Don't you feel the danger to the miracle of life.

Sing when open hearts are calling,
Shout with open eyes (To the miracle of life)
Far below the deepest treasure
To the miracle of life

Living in times of luster, waiting for the flood.
We don't agree with your concepts;
You'd rather be washed in blood.
Is it any wonder? (In my lifetime)
Cold depth of blue water...
Is it any wonder? (In my lifetime)
Rising tides of slaughter - shoulda been washed in blood

Sing when open hearts are calling,
Shout with open eyes (To the miracle of life)
Far beyond your deepest pleasure
To the miracle of life

Pacifica...Indian...Atlantica...



I speak from some sort of protection of learning
Even tho' I make it up as I go on
A special trait is that I've tried
To reach all feelings
So I speak a new language of love

Some say that it is written in the circle
Others that it is written in the sun
But I protect myself by seeing this experience
As a metaphor for moving on

Sometimes I check myself
To start to believe in
The horoscopes you read everyday
They're telling me somethings
I really ought to know
But then again I like to
Then again I learn to
Then again I'm running away

Vision is coming so fast I can't stop myself
Vision forgets who is real
On the city streets, people get lost
Just waiting for history
Pushing the real world away

Taking a chance only once in your life
Only weakness can stop you from hearing
New languages
Translate each word
As they bring you creation
Your voice is the perfect key

Is there something that
I'm supposed to see

Is there something that I'm
Supposed to feel
I'm with you
And I can't help but want to know

(Talk to me)
Is there something that I'm supposed to teach
(Speak to me)
Is there something that I'm supposed to find
As I reach to the healing in each spoken word

For some strange reason time just cannot wait a minute
I'm chasing every second before I let go
Yesterday my history
Dreams are still a mystery
This living is a gift I should know

Lay it down and let me live the new language
Let me learn at every twist every turn
Lay it down and let me love the further future
Let me know I'm running
Let me know I'm learning
Let me know I'm moving on

Vision is racing so fast I can't stop myself
Chasing the reason
For all kinds of wondering
People embracing these feelings of limbo
Just waiting for some kind of truth

Taking a chance as it comes only once
Only strength can do justice
With words of new languages
Translate creation
To bring you salvation
Your voice is the perfect key

(Talk to me)

(New languages)

(Talk to me)
Is there something that
I'm supposed to teach
(Speak to me)
Is there something that I'm supposed to find
As I reach to the healing of each spoken word (new languages)
Is it something that I'm supposed to find
As I reach to the healing of each spoken word (new languages)



Waiting for the moment when the moment has been waiting all the time 
Staring at the golden heights, wondering are you ready for the climb
Are you ready for this?     
If you're ready to believe it, treasure you'll find
Are you ready for that?     
Don't mistake the chance, focus your eyes
Will you take the chance?   
When you're ready to receive it, fear's left behind
Well you've got the time?   
A new perspective
A new state of mind

Always on the edge of what could be the greatest moment in this life 
Watching as the theme builds, left only to wonder in delight
You've got to let it go                         
You've got to let yourself believe in all that can be
Wanting to feel 
Wanting to feel just what it means to be free
There's no reason for deceiving 
There's no reason for deceiving, focus your eyes
To a new perspective 
A new state of mind

Sometimes you feel you want to run away from it all 
Sometimes you hear the voices of the past come to call 
But there's no giving up when you are giving it your all
Hoping, forgiving and loving, the qualities of life 
Designing the future we're building, the dreams taking flight
Are you ready for love?
....

A new state of mind
Waiting for the moment when the moment has been waiting all the time 
Reaching for the golden heights without a doubt you're ready for the climb
You've got to set it out                                                  
You've got to set yourself believing and fortunes you'll find
No escaping                                                                                
No escaping once you've made up your mind
There's a reason for your being                                               
There's a reason for your being, focus your eyes
To a new perspective 
A new state of mind



On a beach
North Africa
Nine tribesmen stand alone
Waiting for a distant call
Waiting for the world to answer
Thru' the night of a thousand stars
Encircled by the light
They began to sing a new song
Of forces that surround us

Nine voices
This dialogue
Nine voices
Singing as one
Nine voices
This dialogue
Nine voices

When the sun came up they sang
As the perfect calendar says
Each had the power of people
Speaking new languages
They gave forgiveness meaning
New ways of letting go
Each child is born for greatness
With forces that surround them

This voice
This dialogue
This voice
Singing as one
Nine voices
This dialogue
Nine voices
Singing as one
His voices
This dialogue

Singing as one

Step out in the night 
When you're lonely 
Listening for the sounds 
That your ears don't hear

I know your cross is heavier 
With every step, every step 
But I know a man 
And he'd walk miles for you

Stop, you stay where you are 
Take a look at yourself 
Take a good look at yourself

Can tell your momma 
She'd only tell ya 
That she told you so

The life you're leading 
She won't believe 
The riches of life 
We all know

Dawn turns to day
And the dawning 
Daytime, nighttime 
And we still can't see

Why must we wait 
Until the morning light 
To wake up and be 
Wake up and be

Wake up and be 
Wake up and be 
Wake up and be

Step out in the night 
When you're lonely 
Listen for the sounds 
That your ears don't hear

I know your cross is heavier 
With every step, every step 
But I know a man 
Who'd walk miles for you

Stop, you stay where you are 
Take a look at yourself 
Take a good look at yourself

Can tell your momma 
She'd only tell ya 
That she told you so
The life you're leading 

She won't believe 
The riches of life 
We all know

Can tell your momma 
She'd only tell ya 
That she told you so

The life you're leading 
She won't believe 
The riches of life 
We all know



There can be no answer for us all
There can be no stopping what is ever changing
Living for the perfect dream
It's time to make a resolution
There will be some peace in our hearts and our minds

We can all find a way to resolve our differences
There's no way we can lose
When we all realize that there are no differences
There's no way we can lose

Ready or not
We can all find a way

We will be forgiving to the ones we love
We will see the blossoming of the new spirit
Shaping everything to our design
We'll build a brighter future
We will free ourselves from the chains that would bind

We can all find a way to resolve our differences
There's no way we can lose
When we all realize that there are no differences
There's no way we can lose
No way we can lose

Ready or not
Ready or not
There's no way we can lose

We can all find a way
Ready or not
Ready or not

We can all find a way to resolve our differences
There's no way we can lose
When we all realize that there are no differences
There's no way we can lose
No way we can lose

Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not

No way we can lose



On the silent wings of Freedom
Where I offer myself midst the balancing of the Sun
On the winds of Celestial Seasons
That would carry me on, midst the balance of being one
On the dream of our love Eternal
That will eventually bring our living once more with you

Where we are coming from
Or where we go
We only know we come with sound

Where we are coming from
Or where we go
We only know we go around and round

On the back of your forty-second screamdown
Do you choose to be lost midst the challenge of being one
On the flight of regardless feelings
As you hurtle to fear midst the challenge of everyone

...

On the darkest night so painful
Do you hunger for love midst the torture of being one
On the passing light of Easing
Have you seen you inside midst the being of Everyone
To the common goal of Freedom
Where we offer ourselves midst the balancing of the Sun

Where we are coming from
Or where we go
We only know we come with sound

Where we are coming from
Or where we go
We only know we go around and round



Contained in everything I do
There's a love I feel for you
Proclaimed in everything I write
You're the light, burning brightly

Onward through the night
Onward through the night
Onward through the night of my life

Displayed in all the things I see
There's a love you show to me
Portrayed in all the things you say
You're the day leading the way

Onward through the night
Onward through the night
Onward through the night of my life

Onward through the night
Onward through the night
Onward through the night of my life



You've got a great imagination

You carry on in the same old way
No lessons learned from yesterday

Talk of changes lost in pages of paperwork

I believe it...
How can we refuse to see
I've received it...
What could be our final destiny
I believe that...
Still we go on from day to day 
Knowing what could be true

Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew

Open your eyes and discover
You're not the only one
In disguise
Do you wonder
When the change is gonna come?

Open your eyes

You've got a great imagination

We cast the world, we set the stage
For what could be the darkest age

Short exchanges
From perfect strangers
We'll never know
But wish we knew

I believe it...
It's time to face reality
I've received it...
Questioning the powers that be
I believe it...
Are we too confused to see?

Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew

Open your eyes and discover
You're not the only one
In disguise
Do you wonder
When the change is gonna come?

Open your eyes
You've got a great imagination
Open your eyes
Show it
Show it

Wish we knew

I believe it...
It's time to face reality
I've received it...
Things aren't what they used to be
I believe it...
What I see in you, you see in me

Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew
Wish I knew

Open your eyes and discover
You're not the only one
In disguise
Do you wonder
When the change is gonna come?

Change is gonna come
Change is gonna come
Change is gonna come
You've got a great imagination

Change is gonna come
Change is gonna come
Change is gonna come
You've got a sweet imagination

Change is gonna come
Open your eyes
Change is gonna come
Open your eyes
Change is gonna come
You've got a deep imagination coming

Toledo was just another good stop
Along the good king's highway
My fortification took me by surprise
And hit me sending me sideways
Spellbound - Roundly - Good for sunshine
Can't help thinking

Singing the Rule Britannia
And this is where it grabs you
There's method in the key of C
Toledo's got to be the silver city
In this good country

Our song
It gives us a reason
Our song
That good remedy
Music has magic
That stuff of syncopation

Ever tried driving it to golden heights
Just simply jiving it
My mystification it got a
Jewel skies crazy spacing it
Hot sun - Crowded - Screams high voices
Singing speechless

Touching of the healing heart
So this is where we really start
Music is a shout of foregone conclusions
As long as music plays its part
Good good part

Our song
It gives us a reason
Our song
That good remedy
Music has magic
It's good clear syncopation

Treat it good
Treat it rightly
And if you get it flowing
The harmony is glowing
So get ready
So get ready
Don't go toledo toledo don't go
Music - Good to you
Music - Good to you



Move yourself
You always live your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself
You are the move you make
Take your chances win or lose her

See yourself
You are the steps you take
You and you - and that's the only way

Shake - shake yourself
You're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Say - you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before

Watch it now
The eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only
You - lose yourself
No not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely
Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

After my own decision
They confused me so
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go
Look before you leap
And don't you hesitate at all - no no
Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than - a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
<i>[repeat]</i>

Owner of a lonely heart

Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start

Owner of a lonely heart

Owner of a lonely heart

Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it

Owner of a lonely heart



When you've tried most everything and nothing's taking you higher
When you've come to realise, you've been playing with fire
Hear me when I say to you, it's really down to your heart

It's the beginning of a new love in sight
You've got the way to make it all happen
Set it spinning turning roundabout
Create a new dimension
When we are winning we can stop and shout
Making love towards perfection

I've been all around the world and seen so many faces
Young and old a story told, filling in my spaces
Now without a trace of doubt, I feel it every hour

It's the beginning of a new love inside
Could be an ever opening flower
No hesitation when we're all about
To build a shining tower
No explanations, need to work it out
You know we've got the power

Parallel our sights
And we will find, that we, we need, to be, where we, belong
Parallel our heights
Display our rights and wrongs, and always, keep it STRONG

It's the beginning of a new love in sight
Could be an ever opening flower
No explanations, need to work it out
You know we've got the power

It's the beginning of a new love inside
You've got the way to make it all happen
Set it spinning turning roundabout
Create a new dimension
When we are winning we can stop and shout
Making love towards perfection

I see the cold mist in the night
And watch the hills roll out of sight.
I watch in ev'ry single way,
Inside out, outside in, ev'ry day.

The sun can warm the coldest dawn
And move the movement on the lawn.
I learn in ev'ry single day,
Inside out, outside in, ev'ry way.

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.

And one peculiar point I see,
As one of many ones of me.
As truth is gathered, I rearrange,
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,
Perpetual change.

And there you are,
Saying we have the moon, so now the stars,
When all you see
Is near disaster gazing down on you and me,
And there you're standing,
Saying we have the whole world in our hands,
When all you'll see,
Deep inside the world's controlling you and me.

You'll see perpetual change.
You'll see perpetual change.

And there you are,
Making it up but you're sure that it is a star,
And boy you'll see
It's an illusion shining down in front of me,
And then you'll say
Even in time we shall control the day,
When what you'll see
Deep inside base controlling you and me.

As mist and sun are both the same,
We look on as pawns of their game.
They move to testify the day,
Inside out, outside in, inside out, outside in,
All of the way.
Ah, Ah.



Get the fire, as the flame it burns,
Get the wind as it slowly turns.
Get the earth as it circles by,
Get the sky see creation fly.

This point of living;
This point of giving;
This chance of living,
Has got to be known.

Get the fire, as the flame it burns,
Get the wind as it slowly turns.
Get the earth...
Get the sky...

Far away, in the depths of Hawking's mind
To the animal, primalistic grind,
You bring me reason, a simple fact of life.
(Bring me reason...)
You don't say you're sorry...

Call this real love
Activiates this mission
To be on the same timeline.
Call this free love
Get a ticket on the master plan.
On the freedom climb.

Get the fire, as the flame it burns,
Get the wind as it slowly turns.
Get the earth...
Get the sky...

This point of living;
This point of giving;
This chance of living
Far away, in the depths of Hawking's mind
To the animal, the primalistic grind,
You bring me reason, a simple fact of life.
You don't say you're sorry...

On the concourse of your fine mind.

Rejoice forward out this feeling
Ten true summers long
We go round and round and round and round
Until we pick it up again

Time flies, on and on it goes
Thru the setting sun
Carry round and round and round and round
Until it comes to carry you home

...

Rejoice forward out this feeling
The white eagle soars
He goes round and round and round
Until the early winds of change

Dawns new light conquering timeless ease
Spread the harvest breeze
Let our hour of passion
Gently hold our heads on high with you

Gently hold our heads on high



Have you heard before, hit it out, don't look back
Rock is the medium of our generation
Stand for every right, kick it out, hear you shout
For the right of all of creation

We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move
The pressure's on is there lack of concentration

Power defy our needs, lift us up, show us now
Show us how amid the rack of confusion
Drive in thoughts of high, satisfy, in a plan
Set it out for all to understand it

We've heard before, but we just don't seem to move
The pressure's on is there lack of concentration

Lost and wondering, maybe, how it is
Seems to me, it's as simple as this
No matter, where you go, you're going to find
You won't see me in front, but you can't leave me behind

Power at first to the needs of each others days
Simple to lose in the void sounds of anarchy's calling ways
All unaccounted for in the craziness of power
In the craziness
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your brother
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your sister
Release, release, enough controllers
Show some signs of appreciated loyalties
Release, release, enough controllers
Show some signs of appreciated loyalties

...

Straight jacket, freedom's march, is it all, far beyond
Our reason of understanding
Campaign everything, anti-right, anti-left
Anticipate the love of creation

Stand for every right
Kick it out, hear you shout
Further the right
Further the right
Further the light
Of all of creation

Power at first to the needs of each other's days
Simple to lose in the void of anarchy's calling ways
All unaccounted for in the craziness of power
In the craziness
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your brother
Release all, release all, or abandon your hope for your sister
Release, release
Release, release
Release, release
Release, release



Innocence no answer
To your breaking heart
If the situation
Sometimes falls apart
Then in this ecstasy
Your charms are frozen
No emotion falling through your arms

Morning, daydream, time still growing shorter
Take me over lead me to the water
To the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
The rhythm of love

Why should I escort you
To your secret needs
Climbing up your ladder
I keep falling down
Anyway will do
Anyone will do
When you dance to your darkest tune
Surrounded
As you crawl around the room
Night time fever burning till you're higher
Take me over lead me through the fire
The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
The rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love

Morning daydream midnight fever
Morning daydream midnight fever
Inhibitions keep you from your point of view
Information needing to confuse
In this situation I have found you
In the rhythm of
Morning daydream midnight fever
Morning daydream midnight fever
Rhythm of love
Rhythm of love
To the rhythm of love
Rhythm of love



The ritual seven notes of freedom to learn and to know the ritual
of life. Life is a fight between sources of evil and pure love.
Alan and Chris present and relay the struggle out of which comes a positive source.
Nous sommes du soleil. We are of the sun. We can see.

Nous sommes du soleil. We love when we play.
Nous sommes du soleil. We love when we play.
Open doors we find our way
We look we see we smile
Surely daybreaks cross our path
And stay maybe a while

Let them run, let them chase
Let them hid between
Constant doors will open eyes
As life seems like
Life seems like a
Fight, fight, fight

Maybe I'll just sing awhile
And then give you a call
Maybe I'll just say hello
And say maybe that's all
Hurry home as love is true
Will help us through the night

Till we're coming home again
Our life seems like
Life seems like a
Fight, fight, fight

Catch as we look and use the passions that flow
As we try continue
We receive all we venture to give

Maybe we'll just stand awhile
And surely we can call
Dreams are said to blossom courage
Constant to the soul

Change we must as surely time does
Changes call the course
Held inside we enter daybreaks
Asking for asking for
The source
The source
The source
Sent as we sing our music's total retain

As we try and consider
We receive all we venture to give
All we say is our
Soul constant sight listener
We won't tender our song clearer
Till we sail
Then I will be there
And I will be there
As clearer companions
Shall call to be near you
They move around tell me that
Move around surely sing
As they don't seem to matter at all
At all at all ...

Hold me my love, hold me today, call me round
Travel we say, wander we choose, love tune
Lay upon me, hold me around lasting hours
We love when we play

We hear a sound and alter our returning
We drift the shadows and course our way on home
Flying home
Going home

Look me my love sentences move dancing away
We join we receive
As our song memories long hope in a way
Nous sommes du soleil
Hold me around lasting ours
We love when we play
Nous sommes du soleil
Nous sommes du soleil
Nous sommes du soleil



I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distant atmosphere
Call it morning driving thru the sound and even in the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you

Along the drifting cloud the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand

Go closer hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears we stand surrounded by million years

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
Twenty four before my love and I'll be there

I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out 'n' out
You spend the day your way
Call it morning driving thru the sound and in and out the valley

In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers we'll be there and laughing too
Twenty four before my love you'll see I'll be there with you



I asked my love to give me shelter
And all she offered me were dreams
Of all the moments spent together
That move like never ending streams.

Run to the light
Everything is alright
Run thro' the light of day
You run to the light of night

And every movement made together
Till every thought was just the same
And all the pieces fit forever
In the game.

Welcome to the light
Now everything is okay
Run thro' the light of night
You run to the light of day.



In the street where we live there's a place called desire.
There's a stone-cold intrusion of mad man's fire,
But he leaves when the lust and desire released,
And you're left with an empty room in peace.

Saving my heart for you - You do what you want to do
There's a place in my heart for you - This time I'm watching you
Till the blood in my veins run dry - I'll be there to testify
There's a place in my heart for you...

I've been lost in the maze of emotional confound.
I believe that you knew our faith was secure;
How you kept-up your smile with a cool disposition,
How you stuck in the fire with a new sense of reason.

You tell me to take it easy, but it's not my style.
You saw me around the corner; it'll pass you by.
I wanna hold you closer to connect my fortunes.
I want take you higher, take it out like we did before.



Shock to the system,
But you're going back inside of the light.
Shock to the freedom,
Only one more body of love in the rolling - They're rolling back to you!
Dreaming all the time; they be dreaming all the time.

Shock to the politicians;
You know they just got burned by the fire.
Shock to the freedom whispers;
They're only coming after the rolling - They're rolling, coming over!
Dreaming all the time; they be dreaming all the time.

So, in answer to the prayer,
The one you want is there,
The one you feel inside of you.
So, in answer to the dream,
This time you are so clear;
It's always got to be this way!
Forever...

Shock to the future;
Shock to the rights of Mankind.
And they won't even go blind,
When they see what's going on.

So, in answer to the prayer,
The one you feel is there,
The one you feel so close to (The order of the Sun).
And everyone is one,
And all the pieces fit together.
Did it all begin with Someone?
Did it all begin with Someone?
I could not admit to being alive!

Shock to the system...



We hit the blue fields
In the blue sedan we didn't get much further
Just as the sun was rising in the mist
We were all alone we didn't need much more

So fast this expidition
So vast this heavy load
With a touch of luck and a sense of need
Seeing the guns and their faces
We look around the open shore
Waiting for something

Shoot high break low
Aim high shoot low
Break high let go
Shoot high aim low

This was to be our last ride
With the steel guitar and the love you give me
Underneath the skin a feeling, a breakdown
Well we sat for hours on the crimson sand

Exchanges in the currency of humans bought and sold
And the leaders seem to lose control

Shall we lose ourselves for a reason
Shall we burn ourselves for the answer
Have we found the place that we're looking for
Someone shouted "open the door"
Lookout

Shoot high break low
Aim high shoot low
Feeling of imagination
Break high let go
Shoot high aim low

Shoot high aim low
Nothing you can say
Shoot high let go
Takes me by surprise

Shoot high aim low
Who says's there's got to be a reason
Shoot high let go
Who says there's got to be an answer

We were all alone, we didn't need much more
Shoot high aim low
The sun's so hard on this endless highway
Shoot high let go
Shoot high aim low
I've heard the singers, who sing of love
Shoot high let go
In the blue sedan we never got much further
Shoot high aim low



Sing, bird of prey
Beauty begins at the foot of you, do you believe the manner?
Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit

Even Siberia goes through the motions, hold out and hold up
Hold down the window (outbound, river)
Hold out the morning that comes into view (bluetail, tailfly)
River running right on over my head

How does she sing?
Who holds the ring and ring and you will find me coming?
Cold reigning king
Hold all the secrets from you as they produce the movement

Even Siberia goes through the motions, hold out and hold up
Hold down the window (outbound, river)
Hold out the morning that comes into view (bluetail, tailfly)
River running right over the outboard, river
Bluetail, tailfly
Luther in time
Dood'ndoodit, dah, d't-d't-dah

Hold down the window
Hold out the morning that comes into view
Warm side, the tower
Green leaves reveal the heart spoken Khatru

Gold stainless nail
Torn through the distance of man as they regard the summit
Cold reigning king
Shelter the women that sing as they produce the movement
River running right on over
Then over my head outboard, river

Bluetail, tailfly
Luther in time
Suntower asking
Cover, lover
June cast, moon fast
As one changes
Heart gold, leaver
Soul mark, mover
Christian, changer
Called out, saviour
Moon gate, climber
Turn round, glider



Does it matter if He broke His spell?
So unreal is the future life along the way (day to day)
To turn around, it all comes through this feel.
It doesn't ring true.

Silent talking in the system, ringing to this beautiful world.
Silent talking, always dreaming, ringing to this beautiful world.
Silent talking in the system, ringing to this beautiful world.
Silent talking, always dreaming, ringing to this beautiful world.



Soft as a dove 
Touching the hand that lays next to me 
Innocent light 
Leading us through a moment in time 

Then you came home 
I let you cry like a father should do 
Innocent light 
Leading us to a moment in time 

Soft as a dove 
Touching the hand that lays next to me 
Innocent light 
Leading us through this moment in time 
Thoughts run away 
You're overcome by a flood of believing 

Just like a dove you're flying away 
Everything beautiful coming your way 
Everything beautiful coming your way



So the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars
In the moonlight she prays for forgiveness that's ours
Only now can she rest from the singing of songs
And the freedom of love

Chances are when you give the love you have
You will find it coming right back
Giving into the love, you know it's right
It's a feeling you'll long remember

Hearts will be chosen.... 
Somehow Someday... 
Hearts will be chosen

Sailing into the dreams of what could be
Reaching out for some form of contact
Waiting for the one you know is right
All you're needing to do, surrender

Someday.....

Hearts will be chosen
Somehow......Someday

Hearts will be chosen

So many times on the clouds of forgiveness
We walk through the country and feel so at ease
A gentle reminder how things really are
In our homelands of love

Face to face with the one you really love
Moving forward down the right track
Chances are when you give all that you have
You will find it flooding right back

Someday.....
Hearts will be chosen
Somehow......Someday
Hearts will be chosen

O'er the green mountains and o'er the green valleys
The blue bird of faith sails far off to the shore
She sleeps on the breeze of the coming of love
For the homelands of Ireland

So many times on the clouds of forgiveness
We walk through the country and feel so at ease
A gentle reminder how things really are
In our homelands of love

So the blue bird will fly o'er the world and the stars
In the moonlight she prays for forgiveness that's ours
Only now can she rest from the singing of songs
And the freedom of love



Faster moment spent spread tales of change within the sound,
Counting form through rhythm electric freedom
Moves to counterbalance stars expound our conscience
All to know and see the look in your eyes.

Passing time will reach as nature relays to set the scene,
New encounters spark a true fruition,
Guiding lines we touch them, our bodies balance out the waves
As we accelerate our days to the look in your eyes.

From the moment I reached out to hold, I felt a sound,
And what touches our soul slowly moves as touch rebounds.
And to know that tempo will continue
Lost in trance of dances as rhythm takes another turn,
As is my want, I only reach to look in your eyes.



A river a mountain to be crossed
the sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
around the south side so cold that we cried
were we ever colder on that day a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

Move forward was my friends only cry
in deeper to somewhere we could lie
and rest for the day with cold in the way
were we ever colder on that day a million miles away
it seemed from all of eternity

The moments seemed lost in all the noise
a snow storm a stimulating voice
of warmth of the sky of warmth when you die
were we ever warmer on that day a million miles away
we seemed for all of eternity

The sunshine in mountains sometimes lost
the river can disregard the cost
and melt in the sky warmth when you die
were we ever warmer on that day a million miles away
we seemed from all of eternity



In this world the gods have lost their way

Can't keep this picture from out of my mind
This fear hand in hand crossing innoncence, time
Surrounding creation they caught in a trap
The youngest offenders will witness confusion

They drive him so fast not a care in the end
Escaping collision every twist every bend
When you're young invincible nothing to lose
Keep seeing this picture standing in a circle
The gods have forgotten to switch on the light
Who's lost in the dark will crash in the night

These lessons we're living the lies of the day
Expect them to honor and never disobey
Yet greed is controlling the elders display
No wonder the younger look at them in shame

The spirit of survival
Who's teaching the hatred
The spirit of survival
Or the class of your school
The spirit of survival
The colour of your money
We're standing in a circle
We don't understand at all

They don't understand at all

In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place
In this world I truly do believe there is a safer place

The younger the older the wiser become
Recover misfortune this true life as one
Our genius is shining the past has all gone
What's left is the clearest perception of one

The spirit of survival
To magnify the power
The spirit of survival
To magnify the soul
The spirit of survival
To magnify the love
We're standing in a circle
We  don't understand at all
We don't understand at all

In this world the gods have lost their way



Sister bluebird flying high above
Shine your wings forward to the sun
Hide the myst'ries of life on your way
Though you've seen them, please don't say a word
What you don't know, I have never heard

Starship trooper, go sailing on by
Catch my soul, catch the very light
Hide the moment from my eager eye
Though you've seen them, please don't tell a soul
What you can't see, can't be very whole

Speak to me of summer
Long winters longer than time can remember
The setting up of other roads
To travel on in old accustomed ways
I still remember the talks by the water
The proud sons and daughter 
That knew the knowledge of the land
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways

Mother life, hold firmly on to me
Catch my knowledge higher than the day
Lose as much as only you can show
Though you've seen me, please don't say a word
What I don't know, I have never shared

Loneliness is a power that we possess to give or take away forever
All I know can be shown by your acceptance of the facts there shown before you
Take what I say in a different way and it's easy to say that this is all confusion
As I see a new day in me, I can also show it you and you may follow

Speak to me of summer
Long winters longer than time can remember
The setting up of other roads
To travel on in old accustomed ways
I still remember the talks by the water
The proud sons and daughter 
That knew the knowledge of the land
Spoke to me in sweet accustomed ways



You can hear the siren screaming,
Take me to the promised land;
See the intervention
Take you higher and higher.
See we are the giving world,
We are responsible,
We're not about to break-

It's just a state of play
It's just a state of play

This is the revolution,
Coming with the giving world
No need to wait for your
Appointment is made.
No need to ask for help,
It's in the love we breathe
Dancing in the new design

It's just a state of play
It's just a state of play

Secret needing,
From this love I'm feeding
High time flying,
From your love I'm feeding
High time flying,
Monumental reaching to god love
Secret needing,
All I really want to know right now...
The state of play
Are you looking at it
Is it looking at you.

It's just a state of play
It's just a state of play

No point in kidding,
Let the children split the atom-
A firm believer this
Appointment with love.
All those who look for glory,
They see the flags are flying,
They hear the sirn screaming-
It's just a state of play
It's just a state of play
Secret needing,
From this love I'm feeding
High time, flying,
All I really want to know,
Right now, right now...
(I want to be inside your heart)
I want to know right now,
Is this the state of play.
Are you looking at it.



Sunshine is creeping in and somewhere in a field a life begins,
An egg too proud to rape the beginning of a shape of things to come,
That starts the run, life has begun, fly fast the gun.
The Mother flew too late and life within the egg was left to fate,
not really knowing how the world outside would take it when it came,
and life's the same for things we aim, are we to blame?
Don't doubt the fact that there's life within you,
yesterday's endings will tomorrow's life give you,
all that dies, dies for a reason,
to put its strength into the Season,
Survival, Survival,
They take away as we give,
The livings right to live,
the livings right to know.
The egg breaks all is out, the crawling bird begins to scream and shout,
Where is the parent bird, a loneliness arose and heard its name-
ring in for life begins, survival win, survivals sin.
So soon the evening comes with it runs the aching
fear of hate could Someone still remain who thinks he
still could gain by escaping fate? it's much too late,
don't underrate, appreciate.
And we're all going
And we're all going
And we're all going somewhere!



Sweet dreams can solve the future,
Sweet dreams provide the past.
Sweet things within your makeup;
These things will always last,
These things will make

Sweet dreams of conversation,
Sweet dreams of love affection.
Sweet words within your makeup;
Sweet words of things to

Come on and write your letter,
You know it will be better anyhow.
You're gonna laugh again,
You're gonna smile again,
You're gonna love again.

Sweet dreams are born inside you,
Sweet dreams are born to last.
Sweet thoughts within your makeup;
These thoughts will always last,
These thoughts will always last.

Come on and write your letter,
You know it will be better anyhow.
You're gonna laugh again,
You're gonna smile again,
You're gonna love again.

Sweet dreams can solve the future,
Sweet dreams provide the past.
Sweet dreams can solve the future,
Sweet dreams provide the past.



She brings the sunshine to a rainy afternoon
She puts the sweetness in and stirs it with a spoon,
She watches for my moods and never brings me down
She puts the sweetness in all around
She knows just what to say to make me feel so good inside
and when I'm all alone I feel I don't want to hide
Today she bought me in and told me where she'd been
She put my mind at rest and put the sweetness in
I'll ask her for some time to go and look around
She puts the sweetness in all around
She knows just what to say to make a sunny day
And when I'm all alone I really don't feel that way.
Tell me how would you feel with no world of your own
and nobody to hold, I just can't see the way
I'm so glad it's today and you're here.



Take the water to the mountain;
Take the river to the sea.
Let the forest be salvation
Long before it needs to be.

Take the water to the mountain;
Let your body flow upstream.
Let it cascade off your shoulders;
Be the body of your dreams.

Take the water to the mountain;
Let the sun shine on your ground.
You decide your every movement;
Let the water to the land.

Take the water to the mountain;
Cross the Great Divide of Love.
Put to Nature all you can give;
Let the Mother know your heart.

Take the water to the mountain;
Let's become alive again.
Holy water, holy mountain,
Holy river, holy tree.

(Undecipherable; any takers?)



Born in the night
She would run like a leopard
That freaks at the sight
Of a mind close beside herself
And the nearer I came
How the country would change
She was using the landscape
To hide herself.

More in the mind
Than the body this feeling
A sense at the end
Of a circular line
That is drawn at an angle
I see when I'm with you
To navigate waters and finally answer to-yes.

If you were there you would want to be near me
Innocence, you could hold all the materials
And though nothing would really be living
It would shock Your fall into landing light
In the north sky time flies fast to the morning
The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us
You were keeping your best situation
An answer to-yes

(Yes, Yes) And the moment I see you
(Yes, Yes) It's so good to be near you
(Yes, Yes) And the feeling you give me
(Yes, Yes) Makes me want to be with you
(Yes, Yes) From the moment you tell me - yes

If you could see all the roads I have travelled
Towards some unusable last equilibrium
Run like an athlete and die like a dead beaten speed-freak
An answer to all of your answers to-yes

In the north sky time flies faster than morning
The cold of the dawn it meant nothing to us
You were keeping your best situation
An answer to Yes

(Yes, Yes) And the moment I see you
(Yes, Yes) It's so good to be near you
(Yes, Yes) And the feeling you give me
(Yes, Yes) Makes me want to be with you
(Yes, Yes) If we wait for an answer
(Yes, Yes) Will the silence be broken
(Yes, Yes) Should we wait for an answer
(Yes, Yes) Do we leave it unspoken

(Yes Yes Yes Yes . . .)



<i>[I. TOGETHERNESS (Instrumental)]</i>

<i>[II. CROSSFIRE]</i>

Julie's sick and tired of her job n'all the reasons lately
She took it out on God and laid her soul to hell and let the baby die
Julie's child was born without a need or a reason for being
She took it as a message from a real and a distant life

Shirley gets to help her with the child though she's strung out on crack time
Shirley never knew what it was to be held in real love
Together getting high to get to mess up their night
Anything to get up so they're losing their mind
Just to get high, breaking out from this life, gotta get them a drug to get higher

Julie gets to walking out and drags the child, says 'come on'
How we'll walk in the dark of the morning
Car is screaming round the corner, drugged to heaven, guns are loaded, locked in vengeance

Who shoots the child?

Watching in the ghetto is the spine and the cruel of the gang life
Sign language of the get go you get in the gang life
Fear the only law, fear is all we hear about,
Feed us in tha raw, fear is all we fear about,
Listen, get up, quickly get up, get up
It's the answer to punishement given you

Don't give us reasons,
Caught in the crossfire dying
God give us reasons,
God get a reason, God give a reason
Why lay dead a child's life?

<i>[III. THE GIVING THINGS]</i>

That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man
That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess
That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him
The pleasure of the giving things within
This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne
And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal

<i>[IV. THAT IS]</i>

That talk is just a worry and a worry in a man
That life is just a worrying and getting in a mess
That deal is just awakening his spirit to be giving him
The pleasure of the giving things within

That word is in it, that talk is in it
This day is of a meeting of the manner to be borne
And like a ship you come safely to the shore of love eternal

That beat is of the wanting of the where you're going
That street talk is the basis of the push and shove
They never told you that you have the right
The spirit of the angel, angels sing "Shaava, shava shava-Shaava"

They be waiting for you, they be asking for you
We depending on you, we depending on your healing of the structure centre
Until you reach and touch your own redemption

They never give you a reason, they never give you a reason
They never give you a, give you a, give you a, give you a reason

<i>[V. ALL IN ALL]</i>

All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Watching for the signals that come easily
Take it as a point of love, a reference place to where you are
Every step a step to set you free

All for the sake and the calling of light
Ask as you give, as you measure in time

All in all this will to give, this sacrament, this need to live
Take it as a step to bring love easily
All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Waiting for the waiting to be free

Talk is the easy end, everyone heard
Ask as you seek the clear, ask and you can

This play is of a myriad of conscience sitting
This day is of a special way of love relating
This sight is in it, this way is in it, the dream is of the positive to
make you
Wonder
How did heaven begin?
This time is in it, this thought is in it, this light is in it,
When you see, you get it

All in all the wisdom call, you shall be young, you shall be free
Take it as it comes so easily

We'll be there beside the sign, the wherewithal, this will to be,
Bringing all the love that's meant to be
All in all we shall be young, we shall be free, we shall be there
All in all this time is meant to be

<i>[VI. HOW DID HEAVEN BEGIN]</i>

These days are just a worry to the children of the world
These days are just a worry to the children of the world
How did heaven begin?
How did heaven begin?

<i>[VII. AGREE TO AGREE]</i>

Don't imagine any way, so any fool can take away the drugs and the pressure
Asking for the level where a world divides its answers
To the gang lords of evil life, they can't show you how
Look upon this life as just a picture you are painting
There is a reason for this being
Look upon this place as just a part of all that is
It is a spiritual part of being

Live with the power, you can be the strength it is
Walk among the living, you can be the strength it is
To give, to live, this hope, comes through,
It takes the trust to agree this agreement
Live for the breaking free
Live for the breaknig freedom
Just let it come through come through



The Ancient probes still further into the past beyound the
Point of remembering. Here Steve's guitar is pivotal in sharpening
Reflection on the beauties and treasures of lots civilisations
Indian, Chinese, Central American, Atlantean. These and other people
Left an immense treasure of knowledge

As one with the knowledge and magic of the source
Attuned to the majesty of music
They marched as one with earth

Sol, Dhoop
Sun
Ilios
Naytheet
Ah Kin
Saule
Tonatiuh
Qurax
Gunes, Grian
Surie
Ir
Samse

So the flowering creativity of life wove its web face to face with
The shallow
And their gods sought out and conquered
Ah Kin

Do the leaves of green stay greener through the autumn
Does the colour of the sun turn crimson white
Does a shadow come between us in the winter
Is the movement really light

And I heard a million voices singing
Acting to the story that they had heard about
Does one child know the secret and can say it
Or does it all come out along without you
Along without you
Along without you

Where does reason stop and killing just take over
Does a lamb cry out before we shoot it dead
Are there many more in comfort understanding
Is the movement in the head

And I heard a million voices singing
Acting to the story that they had heard about
Does one child know the secret and can say it
Or does it all come out along without you
Along without you
Along without you



Feel the calling of a miracle
In the presence of the word.
Now we hold the right to rearrange
How the stories can be heard.

In the beginning is the future,
And the future is at hand;
I'll be calling voices of Africa
Be the rhythm to the plan.

From the Congo to Lenasia
Be the writing on the wall.
I'll be calling the colors of India
See the Asian life explode.

Head in to the headlight.
Don't turn from the rain.
There's a fire raging somewhere near,
Like a longtime friend who's
Seen it darker than ebony.
Take off on the turnpike
(Asking for the first call)
Give me more of the same
(Asking for a song)
There's a fire burning in my heart again.

I'll be calling the dragons of China;
See the dancers of the Nile.
See the wings of change are on display
This revelation mine.

Feel the calling of a miracle
In the presence of the word.
Head in to the headlight.
Don't turn from the rain.
There's a fire raging somewhere near,
Like a longtime friend who's
Seen it darker than ebony.
Take off on the turnpike
(Asking for the first call)
Give me more of the same
(Asking for a song)
There's a fire burning in my heart again.

Feel the calling of a miracle,
The revelation mine.

Stand and fight we do consider
Reminded of an inner pact between us
That's seen as we go
And ride there
In motion
To fields in debts of honor
Defending

Stand the marchers soaring talons,
Peaceful lives will not deliver freedom,
Fighting we know,
Destroy oppression
The point to reaction
As leaders look to you
Attacking

Choose and renounce throwing chains to the floor.
Kill or be killing faster sins correct the flow.
Casting giant shadows off vast penetrating force
To alter via the war that seen
As friction spans the spirits wrath ascending to redeem.

Wars that shout in screams of anguish,
Power spent passion bespoils our soul receiver,
Surely we know.
In glory
We rise to offer,
Create our freedom,
A word we utter,
A word.

Words cause our banner, victorious our day.
Will silence be promised as violence display?
The curse increased we fight the pow'r
And live by it by day.
Our gods awake in thunderous roars,
And guide the leaders hand in paths of glory to the cause.

Listen, should we fight forever
Knowing as we do know fear destroys?
Listen, should we leave our children?
Listen, our lives stare in silence;
Help us now.

Listen, your friends have been broken,
They tell us of your poison; now we know.
Kill them, give them as they give us.
Slay them, burn their children's laughter
On to hell.

The fist will run, grasp metal to gun.
The spirit sings in crashing tones,
We gain the battle drum.
Our cries will shrill, the air will moan and crash into the dawn.
The pen won't stay the demon's wings,
The hour approaches pounding out the Devil's sermon.

Soon, oh soon the light,
Pass within and soothe this endless night
And wait here for you,
Our reason to be here.

Soon, oh soon the time,
All we move to gain will reach and calm;
Our heart is open,
Our reason to be here.

Long ago, set into rhyme.
Soon, oh soon the light,
Ours to shape for all time,
Ours the right;
The sun will lead us,
Our reason to be here.

Soon, oh soon the light,
Ours to shape for all time,
Ours the right;
The sun will lead us,
Our reason to be here.



What have I become?
What am I runnin' away from?
I used to see
Things in a very different way

What am I to do?
I have changed my point of view
I was lost
Now I've found myself in you

From some other part of me
I'll summon the strength to see me through
From deep in the heart of me
To be anything you want me to

And that's when I start to be
The man you've always seen in me
The man you always wanted me to be

What have we become?
What are we running away from?
We need to see
Life in a very different way

Learning what to do
After all that we've been through
No longer lost
We have found ourselves anew

From some other part of me
I'll summon the strength to see me through
From deep in the heart of me
To be anything you want me to

And that's when I start to be
The man you've always seen in me
The man you always wanted me to be

Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah

The man you always wanted me to be
The man you always wanted me to be

Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah
Ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah, ee-yeah



Judging by the voice
He was free to himself so real
We slaved ourselves to sacrifice
More than that we do not know
Then you hear him on the radio
He would play the sacred themes
That my children sang to me

Amazing as it seems 
It was the answer to my dream
His heart that touches me
More than that I do not not know
Then I hear him on the radio
Remembering his every word

That my children sing to me
We have seen the world, this ecstasy
Now my children sing to me
This loving place, beyond belief

You got to stand stand to to together
Keep the message alive 

You got to stand stand to to together
To keep the message alive

Spirit up moving, spirit up
Rhythm of sunfire

You got to stand stand to to together
Keep the message alive

Listening for his words
He would speak in ancient verse
So we mesmerize a way to go
Reaching out the universe
Reaching out the universal
Not afraid to learn new words

That our children sing to us
We have seen the world, this ecstasy
So his children bring to us
This inner peace, beyond belief

You got to stand stand to to together
Keep the message alive 

You got to stand stand to to together
To keep the message alive

Spirit up moving, spirit up
Rhythm of sunfire

You got to stand stand to to together 
Keep the message alive

One voice
One world
One touch
One life... truly, truly say it
One world... one voice
One touch... truly, truly say it
Some people realise
Some people see it 
From the beginning 
One world... one touch
One voice... one life
One touch... one voice... one world... one life



You and I can change the world;
The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.
From this moment on we share the world;
The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.
The spirit of imagination can lead us through the dark;
The more we see, the more we try, the more we show.
The evidence of our confusion, life has left its mark;
The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.

As we walk into tomorrow (Turning away from the path we know)
Holding the future with our hands (We carry the weight of the world we go)
It's up to you and I (We hold the key; we hold the answer)

All our thoughts of doubt and fear (We leave it all by one)
The more we live, the more we learn, the more we know.
For each of us the road is clear and life has just begun;
The more we give, the more we love, the more we grow.
It's time to ease the thoughts we set for ourselves;
The more we fear, the more we lie, the more we hide.
All we need is just to believe in ourselves;
We face the truth, we see it clear, with no disguise.

Cast away our doubt and sorrow (Turning away from the past we know)
The Universe and all can be (Showing the fate of the world we know)
Together you and I, we hold the key to all the answers (Let go)



And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.
Souls will be complicated, life will be consummated then.
Hearts will be brought together soon in our minds forever then.
As long as we see there's only us, who can change it;
Only us to rearrange it at the start of a new kind of day.
And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.
Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.
Thoughts will be thought together, soon in our minds forever then.

Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.
Truth is just for the being and there's the sight for seeing then.
Thoughts will be brought together soon in our minds forever then.
As long as we see there's only us, who can change it;
Only us to rearrange it at the start of a new kind of day.
And in a time that's closer, life will be even bolder then.
Love is the only answer, hate is the root of cancer then.
Thoughts will be thought together, soon in our minds forever then.



Long ago a tall man told a tale of yesterday,
Searching for the truth to life and not for just a way.
Finding pleasure from this house his ears, they did obey;
In his life a moment's pleasure, never to delay.
He was lost and in his trust he found a new meaning;
Seeing the things in diff'rent lights his life was redeemed.

Words of peace will fill his mind and change his way of life;
Peaceful meetings with his heart have made him more alive.
Meeting wise old women on the cliffs of life itself;
Asking not for pers'nal meaning, more for just himself.
Soon we'll be as he proclaimed in a new way of living;
Take the things you need in life but remember the giving.

Prophesy within your mind and you will work it out;
Prophesy that some will die but only those who doubt.
Then you'll never worry as somtimes you used to do;
Just remember when you're gone there's someone after you, you.



As the silence of seasons on we relive abridge sails afloat
As to call light the soul shall sing of the velvet sailors course on
Of the velvet sailors course on
Shine or moons send me memories trail over days of forgotten tales
Course the compass to offer into a time that we've all seen on
Into a time that we've all seen on

High the memory carry on
While the moments start to linger
Sail away among your dreams
The strength regains us in between our time
The strength regains us in between our time
As we shall speak to differ also the ends meet the river's son
So the ends meet the river's son

Ours, the story shall we carry on
And search the forest of the sun
We dream as we dream, dream as one
And I do think very well
That the son might take you silently
They move fast
They tell me
There's someone rainbow
Alternate tune

In the days of summers so long
We danced as evenings sang their song
We wander out the days so long
And I do feel very well
That the evenings take you
Silently. They move round
Sunlight, seeing ground
Whispers of clay
Alternate ways

Softer messages bringing light to a truth long forgotten on
As we shall speak to differ also the ends meet the river's son
So the ends meet the river's son

I reach over and the fruit of life stand still
Stand awhile we search our past we start anew
The music sings of love you knew We walk around the story
Out in the city running free
Sands of companions sides that be
The strength of the meeting lies with you
Wait all the more regard your past
School gates remind us of our class
Chase all confusion away with us

Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returning ways
As certain as we walk today
We walk around the story
Out in the city running free
Days pass as seconds turn the key
The strength of the moment lies with you

Don the cap and close your eyes imagine all the glorious challenge
Iron metal cast to others
Distant drums

Force the bit between the mouth of freedom didn't we learn to fly
Remember to sail the skies
Distant suns
Will we reach
Winds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you

Relayer
All the dying cried before you
Relayer
We've rejoiced in all their meaning
Relayer
We advance we retrace our stories

Like a dreamer all our lives are only lost begotten changes
We relive in seagull's pages
Outwards ways

Things are all in colors and the size of others shall send you
Forward
Arrange to sail you toward
A peace of mind
Will we reach
Winds allow
Other skylines
Other skylines to hold you

Relayer
All the passion spent on one cross
Relayer
Sail the futile wars they suffer
Relayer
We advance we retrace our story, fail safe now

Stand on hills of long forgotten yesterdays
Pass amongst your memories told returning ways
As certain as we walk today
Press over moments leaving you
Out in the city running free
Days pass as seconds turn the key
The strength of the moment lies with you
Out tender outward lights of you
Shine over mountains make the view
The strength of you seeing lies with you

Ours, entrance we surely carry on
And change the passing of the sun
We don't even need to try we are one

And I do think very well
As the truth unfolds you
Silently
They move time
Rainbows
Sunlight
Alternate tune
Alternate tune

Rainbows
Soft light
Alternate view
Sunlight
Tell me
Someone
Alternate view
Alternate view, surely, surely



The Revealing Science of God can be seen as an ever-opening
flower in which simple truths emerge examining the complexities and
magic of the past and how we should not forget the song that has
been left to us to hear. The knowledge of God is a search, constant
and clear.

Dawn of light lying between a silence and sold sources,
Chased amid fusions of wonder, in moments hardly seen forgotten,
Coloured in pastures of chance dancing leaves cast spells of challenge,
Amused but real in thought, we fled from the sea whole.
Dawn of thought transfered through moments of days underseaarching earth
Revelaing corridors of time provoking memories, disjointed but with purpose,
Craving penetrations offer links with the self instructors sharp
And tender love as we took to the air, a picture of distance.
Dawn of our power we amuse redescending as fast as misused
Expression, as only to teach love as to reveal passion chasing
Late into corners, and we danced from the ocean.
Dawn of love sent within us colours of awakening among the many
Won't to follow, only tunes of a different age.
As the links span our endless caresses for the freedom of life everlasting.

Talk to the sunlight caller
Soft summer mover distance mine.

Called out a tune but I never saw the face
Heard but not replaced
I ventured to talk, but I never lost my place
Cast out a spell rendered for the light of day
Lost in lights array
I ventured to see, as the sound began to play

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
I must have waited all my life for this
Moment moment

The future poised with the splendour just begun
The light we were as one
And crowded through the curtains of liquid into sun

And for a moment when our world had filled the skies
Magic turned our eyes
To feast on the treasure set for our strange device

What happened to wonders we once knew so well
Did we forget what happened surely we can tell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment moment

Starlight, movement, reasons
Release forward
Tallest rainbow
Sun shower seasons
Life flower reasons

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe that I can feel it
There's someone to tell you,
Amid the challenge we look around in unison with you

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
Thoughts would send our fusion
Clearly to be home

Getting over wars we do not mean
Or so it seems so clearly
Sheltered with our passion
Clearly to be home
They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to
There's someone, to tell you,
And I just can't believe our song will leave you
Skyline teacher
Warland seeker
Send out poison
Cast iron leader

And through the rhythm of moving slowly
Sent through the rhythm work out the story
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.
Young christians see if from the beginning
Old people feel it, that's what they're saying.
Move over glory to sons of old fighters past.

They move fast, they tell me,
But I just can't believe they really mean to.
There's someone, to tell you
Acourse towards a universal season.

Getting over overhanging trees
Let them rape the forest
They might stand and leave them
Clearly to be home
Getting over wars we do not mean
We charm the movement suffers
Call out all our memories
Clearly to be home

We've moved fast
We need love
A part we offer is our only freedom

What happened to this song we once knew so well
Signed promise for moments caught within the spell
We must have waited all our lives for this
Moment moment

Past present movers moments we'll process the future, but only
through him we know send flowered rainbows
Apiece apart chased flowers of the dark and lights of songs to
follow and show all we feel for and know of
Cast round
You seekers of the truth accepting that reason will relive and
breath and hope and chase and love
For you and you and you.

No need to wonder "do you belong?"
No need to worry, you can be strong
Don't disbelieve it, let your fears go
There must be more to this life and we all know...

Deep inside ... the solution, staring you down
Looking for ... the solution, bringing you round
Round and round we go

The past can haunt your future so
Shadows are falling, look out below
Voices are calling echoes unknown
There must be more to this life than we all know...

Looking for ... the solution, staring you down
Deep inside ... the solution, bringing you round

Giving in, giving out, do the best you can do
Giving in, giving out, it's all up to you
Giving in, giving out, do the best you can do
Giving in, giving out, it's all up to you

Over and under and down we go
(Down we go)
Caught at the crossroads, "Which way to go?"
(Path unknown)
Choosing the right path? Only you know...

Looking for ... The solution, you hold the key
Deep inside ... The solution, set yourself free
Round and round we go, round and round we go

Giving in, giving out, do the best you can do
Giving in, giving out, it's all up to you
It's all up to you
It's all up to you



In the morning when you rise,
Do you open up your eyes, see what I see?
Do you see the same things ev'ry day?
Do you think of a way to start the day
Getting things in proportion?
Spread the news and help the world go 'round.
Have you heard of a time that will help us get it together again?
Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong?
Well, the time is near and the word you'll hear
When you get things in perspective.
Spread the news and help the word go round.

There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the time is now.
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the word is love.

Have you heard of a time that will help get it together again?
Have you heard of the word that will stop us going wrong?
Well, the time is near and the word you'll hear

There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the time is now.
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the word is love.
There's a time and the time is now and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the time is now.
There's a word and the word is love and it's right for me,
It's right for me, and the word is love.



Time has saved as time has moved 
Night has come at last to shine on you 

Last night I looked inside the moon 
And I knew you were real 

So every time I look at you 
You know exactly how I feel 

Time has saved us time has moved 
Night has come at last to shine on you 

Take the time to know how you will fill my life 
Revolving in my heart 

Time has saved us, time has moved us 
Night has come at last to shine on you again



Not a lot is missing
Every ounce of treasure found 
And I believe that everyone should get what
They're allowed
Suspected of belief that comes suspended
In a sound 
And everybody wants some

It's the sound they make in heaven 
It's a sound for here on earth
I've heard it in the whispering
Of  the wonders that we search
We've waited far too long 
To hear the healing of the stars
'N' everybody wants some

Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some
To feel alive

Oh - does it get much better than this
Oh - does it get much better, much better
Oh - does it get much better than this, than this

There's the sound that keeps you trying
There's the sound that makes you smile
There's a sound in every corner 
Of the world that we survive

Your temple is the harmony
You feel the sacred ground 
Just wishing for the secret
To appear within the sound
Watching for the morning star 
The rhythm of the sun
I hear it in my waking dreams
The singing has begun

The passion that we walk upon
The passion that we bring
Is written for the mountains
They love to hear us sing

Everybody wants some
Everybody wants some 
Everybody wants some 
Everybody wants some 
To feel alive

Oh - doesn't get much better than this
Oh - doesn't get much better than this, than this

Who made me make believe
I'm alive I'm living
Never underestimate
The signals coming to you
Oh
The sounding of the earth 
It shakes you, yes it shakes you
Oh
The sounding of the earth
It shakes you, let it shake you

Hep yadda



We go sailing down the calming streams,
Drifting endlessly by the bridge.
To be over, we will see, to be over.

Do not suffer through the game of chance that plays;
Always doors to lock away your dreams.
Think it over, time will heal your fear, think it over.
Balance the thoughts that release within you.

Childlike soul dreamer.
One journey, one to seek and see in ev'ry light
Do open true pathways away.

Carrying closer,
Go gently, holding doors will open ev'ry way
You wander true pathways away.

After all your soul will still surrender.
After all don't doubt your part,
Be ready to be loved.



Realising a form out of stone,
Set hands moving. 
Roan shaped his heart,
Through his working hands. 
Worked to mold his passion into clay, 
Like the sun. 

In his room, his lady,
She would dance and sing so completely. 
"So be still," he now cries,
"I have time, oh let clay transform thee so." 

In the deep cold of night, 
Winter calls, he cries "Don't deny me!" 
For his lady, deep her illness. 
Time has caught her,
And will for all reasons take her. 

In the still light of dawn, she dies. 
Helpless hands soul revealing. 

Like leaves we touch, we learn. 
We once knew the story. 
As winter calls he will starve,
All but to see the stone be life.

Now Roan, no more tears. 
Set to work his strength,
So transformed him.
Realizing a form out of stone,
His work so absorbed him.

Could she hear him? 
Could she see him? 
All aglow was his room,
Dazed in this light. 
He would touch her,
He would hold her.

Laughing as they danced,
Highest colors touching others. 

Did her eyes at the turn of the century,
Tell me plainly.
How we'll meet, how we'll love, 
Oh, let life so transform me. 

Like leaves we touch, we dance. 
We once knew the story. 
As autumn called and we both,
Remembered all those many years ago. 
I'm sure we know. 

Was the sign in the day with a touch,
As I kiss your fingers. 
We walk hands in the sun,
Memories when we're young, 
Love lingers so. 

Was it sun through the haze,
That made all your looks, 
As warm as moonlight? 
As a pearl deep your eyes, 
Tears have flown away, 
All the same light. 

Did her eyes at the turn of the century,
Tell me plainly.
When we meet, how we'll look, 
As we smile time will leave me clearly. 

Like leaves we touch, we see,
We will know the story. 
As autumn calls we'll both remember,
All those many years ago.



Looking up into the endless sky
Staring into the maze of time
Our existance caught in the blink of an eye
Imagining other words we try
Realizing somehow we're all part of this
Wondrous cosmical tapestry

Beyond the sun
Beyond the sky
Are where the real questions lie
Wanting to know where it begins
The puzzle piece we are missing

Starlight
Flowering
Endlessly through the universal garden
Garden above

Looking up into the endless sky
Through space and time
Staring into the maze of time
We'll fly
Our existence caught in the blink of an eye
Retracing years
Imagining other worlds we try
No fears
Realizing somehow we're all part of this
Blazing a new trail
Wondrous cosmical tapestry

Beyond the sun
Beyond the sky
Are where the real questions lie

Wanting to know where it begins
The puzzle piece we are missing

Starlight
Flowering
Endlessly through the universal garden
Garden above

Investigate the science of illusion
We benefit without knowing

Our time is man-made
Our fear is man-made
Delusion man-made
Religion man-made

Love is forever
Flowering
Endlessly through the universal garden
Garden above

Beyond the sun
Beyond the sky
Are where the real questions lie
Wanting to know where it begins
The puzzle piece we are missing

Beyond the sun
Beyond the sky
Are where the real questions lie

Universal garden



Don't you know it's my way out
To be on my own.
When I feel like crying out
I do it best alone.
Can you give me love and
Protection to shield my heart.
All the fear I feel from doubt
Is tearing me apart.

I wanna love, I wanna give,
I want to find another way to live.
Another shout, another cry,
And the walls come tumbling down.

Don't you know there's no way out;
Your pain's your own,
And the more we scream and shout
The more we feel alone.
I can feel my anger rising-
Am I to blame?
And I'm not gonna keep it inside me.
Do you feel the same?

I wanna love, I wanna give,
I want to find another way to live.
Another shout, another cry,
And the walls come tumbling down.
And I'm calling you.



Answers never clear again 
This turning of the page 
This turn look away 

There I took a left turning 
Before I came of age 
I agreed to let it out 
I agreed to let it go 
I agreed to turn around 
I agreed to turn my face away 

Danger is the most important 
Fear you'll ever know 
The transporting of refugees 
The silent night is cold 

And all the time 
We looked around 
As we were never told 

But we agreed to let it out 
We agreed to let it go 
We agreed to turn our backs 
We agreed to turn our face away, away 

Thousands to the million 
Sisters, grandmothers and more 
It's not the feast we throw away 
It's the way we close the door 

Their silence deafens every sound 
We try just to ignore 
To waste their future freedom 
We'll regret forever more 

I believe in 
I believe in 
These are the days that we will talk about 
I believe in 
I believe in 
One understanding what is real 

If we are one 
Then we are refugees 
We are the prisoners of our own design 
If we are one 
Seen through the eyes of a child 
We will perpetuate this song of love 
If we are one 
Seen through the eyes of a child 
We will perpetuate this song of love 
If we are one 
Seen through the eyes of a child 
We will perpetuate this song 
Perpetuate this song of love 

Now we build the bridges 
That we walk upon together 
At the last count many lonely souls 
The sadness always kills 

Each breaking point is waiting 
For the promise to fulfill 

When we agree to turn the page 
When we agree to help them free 
When we agree to let it out 
When we agree to let it shine 
When we agree to let it run 
When we agree to let it change our lives 

I believe in, our lives 
I believe in, our lives 
These are the days we will talk about 

When we are one 
Seen through the eyes of child 
We will perpetuate this song of love 

When we are one 
Seen through the eyes of child 
We will perpetuate this song of love 
Song of love 

Yeah, yeah, perpetuate this song of love 

Seeing through the eyes of child 
Seeing through the eyes of child



Tell the Moon-dog, tell the March-hare
Tell the Moon-dog, tell the March-hare
We...have...heaven
To Look around, to look around
Yes, he is here; Yes, he is here



Where will you be when you're not here.
How many lives in this earth time.
You are my soul and this you are.
Two should intertwined,
That's what we are.

We can, we walk, hand in hand,
All the life,
Be the one, everything to me;
You, I am dreaming.
We have lived and known before,
I feel it.

Where will you lie.

When will I know when you are gone.
Where I be, and I will miss you.
We are this love in this life,
Two should intertwined like once before.
See this meeting, hand in hand,
Every life,
Be the one, everything to me;
You are my feeling.

No need to fear this love of life,
We are the truth of every earth life.
No need to fear this life at all,
We are the sun and everlasting life.
Where will you be hearing this song.
How many lives in this earth time.
You are my soul and this you are.
You are my soul and this you are.

Where will you lie



I see a man in a white car
Move like a ghost on the skyline
Take all your dreams
And you throw them away
Man in a white car.



Hold still now for the moving information close to you.
You could never force it in your life: this decision to break it.
Without hope, you cannot start the day.

It's coming clear I've noticed;
It's a different face you're showing.
It's another "Welcome Back".
I don't imagine it could be this way (So jealous).
Only you can tell it; tell me why.
Only you call tell it.
Only you can say.
Inbetween this moving out to save your soul it came away,
And took it out;
Oh why?

Fire burning wild, burning in the night, chasing in the wind;
Shadows always dance in the rain, ringing into the fire.
Doesn't matter who, who can see in the smile.
Hope in the rain, open the flame, coming back in the night.
I can see the rhythm of the rain; I can see it shout back under:

I can see what you're thinking of
I can see what you think you need
I can see what you're thinking of
I can see that it must be love

Shadows come alight from the vision that flowed;
Shake it off - Passion is the flame that fired.
Does it matter? Can you give? Can you hear it come?
Can you see you're like?
What's the matter? Don't you want to risk? Don't you want to hold me?
Hold me, dance in the rain.
I can see the love in your eyes; I can see you coming.

I can see what you're thinking of
I can see what you think you want
I can see what you're thinking of
I can see that it must be love

Sweet suffering, love protection: Need it, You need; Come to me.
Believe it, better by far, your heart it there;
Most of all: Believe it.
Perfection Reaction...



I believed that one day love would cast a line
I believed there was something more for me to find
Hoping today
Hoping tomorrow
Taking it all in stride
I believed
I could be chasing my mind

There you were
Like a dream to me
Wonderlove
Could this really be
Wonderlove
Can I make you see
You're the world to me

I believe if only we could take the time
Eventually we would learn each other's life
Open your heart
Give it a moment
Leaving the cares behind
Happily
We could be two of a kind

There you were
Like a dream to me
Wonderlove
We were meant to be
Wonderlove
Can I make you see
You're the world to me

It was the very next day that I came alive
The door flung open
There was a vision
Couldn't believe my eyes
Everyone immortal like as though they didn't get it
Everyone believing here at last receiving
Wonderlove
It's a place we all belong
Wonderlove

Wonderlove
Can I make you see 
You're my world 

I believe I could walk a thousand miles
Just to see the vision of your simple smile
Everyday
Wanting to follow
Forever by your side
Faithfully
You are my destiny

There you were
Wonderlove
We were meant to be
Wonderlove
It's the world where we belong
Wonderlove
Together we will faithfully
Wonderlove
Can I make you see 
You're the world to me

Just imagine what you give is who you are and where you're going to
If you're looking for the wisdom of the world
All you've got to do is let it coming through
Be forever

Just imagine
Wonderlove



I awoke this morning
Love laid me down by the river
Drifting I turned on up stream
Bound for my forgiver
In the giving of my eyes to see your face
Sound did silence me
Leaving no trace
I beg to leave, to hear your wonderous stories
Beg to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA'

He spoke of lands not far
Nor lands they were in his mind
Of fusion captured high
Where reason captured his time
In no time at all he took me to the gate
In haste I quickly
Checked the time
If I was late
I had to leave, to hear your wonderous stories
Had to hear your wonderous stories 'LA AHA, LA AHA'

Hearing
Hearing hearing your wonderous stories
Hearing your wonderous stories
It is no lie I see deeply into the future
Imagine everything
You're close
And were you there
To stand so cautiously at first
And then so high
As he spoke my spirit climbed into the sky
I bid it to return
To hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories
Return to hear your wonderous stories
LA AH LA AH AH AH

Hearing
Hearing
Hearing

Why is there you,
When there are few,
People making me feel good.
Why is there me,
When air is free,
Some I can see better than I should,
There's only us,
simply because,
Thinking of us makes us both happy
I think of you everyway, yesterday and today,
I think of things we do all the way everyday
Stand in the sea
sing songs for me,
Sing happily making me feel good,
Watching your eyes,
Feeling your sighs,
saying goodbyes better than I could,
There's only us,
simply because,
Thinking of us makes us both happy
I think of you everyway yesterday and today,
I think of nothing but you things we do, things we do.



Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human race
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer change to winter, yours is no disgrace

Battleships confide in me and tell me where you are
Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are
Lost in summer, morning, winter, travel very far
Lost in losing circumstances, that's just where you are

Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human race
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer change to winter, yours is no
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace

Death defying, mutilated armies scatter the earth
Crawling out of dirty holes, their morals, their morals disappear

Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face
Caesar's palace, morning glory, silly human, silly human race
On a sailing ship to nowhere, leaving any place
If the summer change to winter, yours is no
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace
Yours is no disgrace

Battleships confide in me and tell me where you are
Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are
Lost in summer, morning, winter, travel very far
Lost in losing circumstances, that's just where you are
